4136,dev_pid_4137,"I Just Realized Why I do Poorly in School Moments ago : I’m currently a Sophomore in high school and have generally always had bare minimum/poor grades. For years my parents wrote it off as laziness because I seemed to do well on tests (usually A’s without studying). Last year I was diagnosed with ADHD, which would explain past problems with school so I started taking meds. This school year is the first I have taken my meds and am still barely scraping by in college prep classes, but tonight I had an epiphany as to my problem. I have always had a caring and supportive group of friends that have always been in honors classes, they all were nice, except for one. This kid (Let’s call him Joe) Has always been a consistent asshole by turning jokes against me, my friends against me, and of course ridiculing me for being in lower classes. It is unfortunately unavoidable since we hang out with the same people so I tryyy to be nice to him...as much as possible anyways. 
Sorry for the rant but TL;DR I think this asshole caused me to have depression

4137,dev_pid_4138,"my libido is extremely low and id like to fix that so i can move to the next step with my girlfriend : im on an ssri, so of course my libido is basically zero. id like to move forward with her into the more physical parts of the relationship, im just having trouble. 
i think a lot of it is mental + the meds. i have trouble kissing her for more than a few seconds, even if theres a part of me that really wants to go more. its like i get so in my head about everything and so convinced that my meds side effects are gonna fuck it up that i cant actually focus on her.

When I get over one thing, then something else takes its place. they're things most people probably woudnt think twice about, but it'll send me into a full blown panic. There hasnt been a moment I havnt been panicking (except for in my sleep) for the past 8 years. I've tried meds, which only made my anxiety worse. I ended up taking 4 days off of work, because I suddenly became terrified of driving. I also recently took a few days off, because I was worried about the caronavirus. I've tried going to a therapist, which helped with the issues I was dealing with at the time, but like I said, new issues just replace the old issues as soon as I get over them. Also, therapy was just way to expensive. I've had people guess I was in my 40s. That's how much the anxiety has taken a toll on my physical appearance. I just dont see an end to this.

I’ve been in therapy for a while, and my therapist suggested that I seek medication. My insurance doesn’t cover seeing a psychiatrist, so I’ve made an appointment with a general practitioner. I haven’t seen this doctor before.
I’ve been on various antidepressants in the past, and one in particular worked *far* better than others for me. It’s not a controlled substance, and has no potential for abuse. So I’m going to go into the doctor’s office and ask to be put on that medication again—simple, right?
Welp, I’m terrified. I’m afraid she’ll say no, think I am a drug-seeking malingerer, or just otherwise react poorly and not prescribe me the medication. Has anybody gotten medication from a GP before? Do I actually have anything to worry about? Anybody have any words of reassurance? It’s been ten years since I’ve been on medication and I’m pretty nervous about getting it.

I was born in late 2004 my mother was then 17 almost 18 my father was 32 and had no clue what he was doing with his life and no he was never reported for being with a minor but he was with another woman of around the same age of my mother at the time and my sister who is older than me by a couple months was born my mother imediatedly got custody of me as my dad did not want to get caught while in court around the time I turned two or three the other woman figured out about me and my mother and soon had my then youngest sister after divorcing my father my father was extremely abusive towards me only untill i was about 8
Around the time i turned 4 or so my now youngest sister was born from my mother to a physically abusive man who abused me and my mother and was eventually locked away for battery charges and last I heard is wanted in my state 
When I turned 8 I was diagnosed with ADD for those of you who dont know what that is its the opposite of ADHD pretty much im always tired and i was prescribed Adderall my mother who i lived with soon found a new man who in time also showed his true colors and was abusive to me and mother did nothing 
My mother soon started using marijuana and was cheating on her then fiance with our neighbor i was then around ten within the next year my mother was hooked on meth and I was then moved into her mother my grandmothers house leaving my sister behind not too long after that I was prescribed Zoloft for depression and ADD 
I am now 15 no longer on meds other than a couple assorted supplements for sleep issues and my sister is also moved in with us  i have better grades than usual and i have a girlfriend

I work as a dog walker. Lots of days I walk dogs for about four hours, and most of them are reactive/agressive and untrained. Basically dealing with that helped push me over the edge and now I'm facing it again on Monday. Love the dogs but I don't handle tiredness or stress well at all. Because of not working for over a week I have almost no money  - a little cash (enough for a week or two of food) and 12c in my bank account. With dog walking I don't make enough to cover rent and my parents help me financially. 
I just don't know what to do. Thinking about Monday brings back all the despair and hopelessness but I'm terrified of telling my clients that I'm done. I have no qualifications, no specific long term career skills or experience and huge trouble interacting with people.
I just don't know what to do as if I quit I'll have to face a new job and no money until I find one. I was accepted to do a six month course in photography but need a lot more money to register.

4149,dev_pid_4150,"Persistence is key... 🗝 : Hey guys. I (f25) have been struggling my depression and anxiety since I was about 13. I have been through most types of abuse that you can think of on a long term basis and had 2 nervous breakdowns/ major depressive episodes.
I am telling you because one year ago today I was made homeless, for the second time that month. I was *absolutely* failed by my family for the last time. 
I have been on anti depressants since i was 13 but obviously, they take some tinkering so lots of chopping and changing and no steady regulation until about 4 years ago! 
After my second NBD/ MDE my doctor tinkered one my time, giving me the maximum dose of my current medication and increasing my anti anxiety medication. This helped a lot! 
BUT becoming homeless and moving into a hostel, I hit rock bottom. Rock. Bottom. 
Suicidal thought so intense and strong but contracted by the immense love I have for my partner was torture. Like, *actual torure*. 
So I started seeing the hostel therapist. 
She gave me tools to start changing the way I think but to also go back into my memories and process past trauma. I don't know what really happened from there because my brain and subconscious seemed to just take over! 
So far we have: 
1. Regulated meds
2. Therapy
3. Coping mechanisms put in place in times of crisis
Sounds perfect right?! Like shit just *fell* into place?! 
**HELLS NO!!**
THINGS WERE SO TOUGH! The past year has been brutal! 
Speed forward to this week. Again, I don't know what happened as my brain has just been driving and *I've allowed it*.
I have been sluggish in the mornings *but* got a second wind in each late morning/early afternoon! 
I have been productive! I have left my flat! I have been wearing makeup, showering, doing my hair, going to the shops... ect. 
I was convinced I was going to eventually succumb to the torture of my brain and get so tired I'd just give in to the temptation of opening up my arms. 
When people say give it time, please try and be patient! Get frustrated, shout, cry, sleep in, leave the washing up/housework or whatever... whatever you gotta do to get through the day, do it! Because *right now* is **happening**. You need to take care you **right now You**. 
This post ended up longer than I intended but if you got this far, please remember, hard work isn't always visible. It can absolutely be internal and exhausting!!

4150,dev_pid_4151,"Starting my first ever SSRI (Celexa) today. Also on Buspar. Could use some insight! : Cross-posted in r/anxiety 
Starting my first ever SSRI (Celexa) this weekend. Also on Buspar. Could use some input.
After being on Buspar for a few months, it’s helped my anxiety to the point where I don’t really have panic attacks anymore, and my general daily anxiety has subsided a bit. But I’m definitely not 100%. Even though the anxiety is subsiding, I still don’t feel ‘normal.’ In fact, I’ve felt “blank” for years due to anxiety and depression, my baseline is quite low. I don’t really know what it’s like to feel ‘normal’ or 100%. I’m just used to dealing with it day to day. I told my doc all of this the other day while checking how the Buspar was working.
When I look to my future, I don’t really see one. Not because I’m suicidal or anything (thankfully I don’t have those thoughts,) but because it just feels like I’m living day by day without much projection in my life. I go to work, go home, and my social life is really bland for a 24 yr old guy. 
The doc said that Depression is definitely comorbid with my anxiety (you don’t say!) and prescribed be Celexa. I’ve never been on an SSRI, the only med I’ve ever been on regularly has been Buspar. I’m a little nervous to start it, for some reason. I’m supposed to take my first dose this morning. Doc said the only side effect I’ll probably run into is drowsiness. She specifically chose Celexa because apparently it has less severe side effects when compared to Zoloft for a guy my age.
Anyone have some input for my situation? It’d be greatly appreciated!",severe
4151,dev_pid_4152,":) : idk if i have depression, tbh. all i know is i am worthless, useless, stupid, fat, and unpredictable. i think this all started when i just shower everyone with trust and love.
let me tell you something about myself. i was jolly, quirky, playful, and silly when i was a kid. i am friends with everybody in the class.
back to the story..
i met my childhood ""ex best friend"" back in 4th grade. were so close that no one could ever separate us. you'd see us having lunches together, have tutoring sessions together, playing together, and everything that normal child besties do. but everything changed when we met our 3rd best friend. they started to hang out much more, leaving me behind but i didn't mind cus hey, i'm glad that we have more friends to do everything with. all went well until 6th grade. my ""ex best friend"" started to get distant; like she would always try to avoid talking to me, having eye contact, or even sitting next to me. i got really sad that time. what did i do to make her avoid me? and that lasted for months. time passes by and graduation was approaching. we had a little kick-off party for the whole class. i was a bit hesitant on attending the party bc i was just not in the mood for anything but i went anyways. not bc the teacher said everyone should go but bc my mom told me to spend the last day of school with my ""friends"". so i did. and that wasn't pleasing at all. when i arrived in school my other friends immediately asked me if i was going to my ""(ex) best friend's"" pool party the day after graduation. of course i didn't know about this so-called pool party my best friend will held for her ""friends"". so they were shocked as i am. one friend stood up and told me something about me and my best friend's 3rd best friend from 4th grade. she told me that she's been bad mouthing me from the very beginning. j just fell totally silent at that moment ad my world began crumbling into pieces. 
fast forward, graduation was over and time for high school. i was still down the whole summer and i wanted to get away from people i knew bc i would think that they were all gossiping fallacies about me. so i decided, no. i want to go to a new school for a change of environment. but it was not what i expected to be. i had a hard time making new friends and with a span of 3 days, i quitted that school. then my mom moved me to a high school in our town where all of my elementary classmates were. luckily, they were based on the science oriented classes. and i was enrolled to an arts based curriculum. everyone was nice to me and i started to gain confidence again. until a group of friends bullied me for years. so i found refuge in food. i began to eat a lot when i get sad, or happy. all was fine until i gained weight and my body wasn't pleasing to look at anymore. and guess what, those bullies started to pick on my body a lot more. they'd be shouting ""walk faster, fatso. you're blocking our way"" and shits like that. so, i started to eat less thinking that if i'd be skinnier, everyone would like me. years went by and i did lost a couple of pounds. i found myself happy again. 
now, during my teenage years, my father would always have something to say to every action i make. idk why but i just thought maybe he's just tired from work. so i let it slide. 
but on december 2019, my crumpled up world burned into ashes. 
my father and i were sitting on the bench in the mall, waiting for mom to finish in the public restroom. he was complaining to me about the agency he was working at, so i just listened and told him that it's going to be fine. but then he uttered, ""i wish i hadn't build this family too early."" 
that made me stopped listening to him and those words kept repeating inside my head. so he regretted having us? having me? or this family? like wth? we were a mistake? is that why he's always hot-headed with me? 
shit happened and i couldn't take everything they were throwing at me. the pain was unbearable to the point where i would shiver every night while crying. sometimes, i'd just contemplate whether to take my own life or not. but then i thought of my mother. i wanted to give her a better life and make her smile more. i don't want to leave her first because that would crush her. so what i do is sometimes, i'd just grab the nearest sharpest object and cut my wrists. it was painful but it was good. it is so addicting that everytime the pain was too extreme i'd do it again and again and again and again until i can feel the pain on my wrists, not the one in my chest.",severe
4152,dev_pid_4153,"I feel like I’m rotting. Don’t know what to do anymore... : 
I liked myself in 2015. In 2016 I had a big breakdown and was hospitalised. since then I feel like each year I’ve been slowly rotting away, losing every part of me that made me feel unique or interesting, just becoming nothing. I think my soul died. I feel like an evil, awful person every day and that the universe is going to punish me for something. I feel cursed and like I can’t set goals for the future because I feel so sure if I try to do anything with my life something awful will happen to me and ruin everything. 
I’m feeling pretty hopeless. At this point I’m honestly not sure what to do. I used to be very social but I find I’m extremely overwhelmed by everything recently and have been isolating myself a lot of the time to decompress. It makes me so sad that I can’t follow my passions but doing anything positive just makes me feel guilty like I’m not allowed to be happy and that I’ll be punished for it horribly.
I’ve been told I have OCD, Depression and anxiety. I spend nearly all day consumed with ideas that terrify me. I’m really stuck on my obsession with morality and good and evil. I’m afraid I’ve done awful things and forgotten about them or sometimes I have upsetting false memories that are hard to tell if they’re real or not. Trying to be a good person is very important to me and the idea of hurting someone kills me.
I’ve tried lots of different medications and some of them work for a while but then seem to stop. I’m on 90mg of cymbalta currently and it helped for a little while but not really anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have a psych but they’re busy so I only get to see them once every few weeks but it’s not enough. I feel like if I have any chance of getting better I need much more intensive help or a big change in medication or something. 
Sorry for the rant, I don’t know if I’m explaining myself well, I’m just sick of feeling like this and watching myself slowly disappear and rot away. I hope that reincarnation is real so that when I die I can have another chance at life because I often feel like this one is ruined. I cut myself for the first time in a few months last night and then immediately felt embarrassed and guilty.

I’d say drugs are the only thing keeping me standing. one day though, drugs will kill me. and for some reason im ok with that. i am super fucked up because i have that rotten perception stuck in my brain about life, about how there’s no point to life, and the second you die it’s like you never even existed; lights out.",severe

4156,dev_pid_4157,"A life rant : I moved across the country with my boyfriend 6 months ago. His work wanted to move him and we saw it as a golden opportunity to see a new part of the world together.
I had just completed 2 years of an engineering degree. I was miserable. That 2 years took me 4 years to finish. Those 4 years were a rollercoaster of depression &amp; anxiety. I decided to ditch that degree.
Moving felt right. I didn't know anyone in our new city, but in all fairness, I didn't have many friends at my university anyway. My plan had been to complete an online degree and get a job. I quickly decided that doing a degree online was not for me, so I decided to start a nursing diploma. 
I'm a month into a 20 month program. I can't concentrate in class and the 6 hours of sitting in a chair makes me crazy restless. Days go by and it feels like hours. I crash in bed when I get home and sleep 16 hours a day.
Everything is going downhill. I've been switching depression meds over the past few weeks and I feel awful. I don't have a doctor that I trust. I know my boyfriend is stressed about my condition but he doesn't know what to do with me. I have no motivation to leave the apartment, workout, cook, clean, or study. I'm eating junk and gaining weight. I just want to not exist. I'm thinking about suicide for the first time since high school. I know I could never actually do it.
I just feel like I have all the tools to succeed right now, and yet I still just can't do it. It feels like every doctor I see, every person that knows about my depression, they don't think it's that bad, since I'm clearly showering, eating and not going to kill myself. They are uninterested in referring me to a specialist, even though the meds &amp; therapy haven't been working. They rush through my appointment and print off an Rx for another antidepressant. Or raise the dose of the current one. 
What the hell am I going to do. How do I stop being like this. I just want to hold a regular schedule of waking up, eating, showering, going to school, studying, working out, cooking. Why does going through those motions make me want to die. Or at least fall asleep. Where do I go from here.",severe

recently im really spending a lot of time and energy and money to get myself somewhat straight so i can live a life that i want. But as a result for the past 4 months i live on a constant roller coaster. I had developped some psychosomatic symptoms like headaches, fatigue and brain fog long time ago i guess as a getaway to avoid feeling whatsoever, but since recently i am all over the place. I can cry few times during the day because im tired and sick of myself and the world and especially coming back to the same states  of mind that feels so familiar  and everlasting. However i sometimes just click out of it (meditation helps a lot) but i end up at this somewhat overhyped state of projecting myself into the future how i will do all what i want and be like i want and learn what i want and suddenly things start to interest me and hope is alive. 
But. what is holding me from doing what i want   whenever i feel better is my lack of concentration and this overly happy feeling that everything will be alright. Like im too busy about thinking and projecting myself into the future rather than actually taking action, and if i do take action, i end up kind of feeling overly proud of myself like a kid who did something stupid that everyone could but still feeling special about it. i always feel like im everywhere but the present moment and its frustating and tireing and always leading nowhere else but to a dead end where the relapse is waiting. 
I was wondering do you people feel this too or is it my fucked up personality that is dictated by my genes or parenting ir whatever.

4160,dev_pid_4161,"I've kinda just lost interest in most things : Hi, I'm new here. I've never been diagnosed with depression, and I think I struggle way more with anxiety than depression. Over the years, however, I feel like I've been losing interest in life. I hate to complain, and I realize that my problems are tiny probably compared to most other redditors on this subreddit, but I felt like I had to get some of this out anyway.
Anyway, nothing really excites me anymore, and the only things I derive moderate enjoyment out of are EDM and weightlifting. I've been dealing with some shit in the past few years, including family health problems, social anxiety, addictions, etc... but I've acquired some coping mechanisms for these. However, I have no idea how to cope with a complete lack of interest in the things life has to offer.
The biggest issue I'm having with this lack of interest is figuring out what to do in school. I'm in my 4th semester at an expensive university right now with a major in Mechanical engineering and Computer science. I am doing ok in these, but I have very little interest in either and that's causing me to lose a lot of motivation and discipline. There's a chance I'm not interested because I haven't really committed myself to either/had professional exposure, but I don't want to be wasting my family's money on stuff I'm not passionate about. I have no idea what area of study I'd switch to either, as again, I have no other identifiable interests. 
Being stuck at home because of coronavirus has given me some time to think about this stuff, and I am trying to figure out what I should do. I wish I could just force myself to be interested in things, but I think it's a combination of anxiety, low self-esteem, and (maybe) depression that is preventing me from doing so. I was thinking of taking medication, such as prozac, but I don't know how effective that would be. What kind of course of action would y'all suggest for someone in my shoes?",severe

It's helped me realise a few more things about myself, which is good, but as anyone here knows any upside is drowned by the negative.  In life I'm lost.  I have goals I feel like I want to achieve, but truth be told I've lost what it felt like to be passionate about something awhile ago.  At this point I just go through the motions replicating what I remember passion and energy felt like, while apathy eats away at whatever I have left.  My friends are to busy with there lives for me to bother them with my issues.  My family has never cared about my issues, and would prefer to pretend they and I don't exist.  Work is the same as you can imagine in the USA, you're a cog they use till they see its breaking and then they throw it away.  I don't want to harm myself and am not considering suicide, nor do I think I ever will again.  But I  can't do anything except invision this person I want to be and wish I was, everday knowing I'm not that person and seeing how unlikely it is I'll ever be that person.  I feel like I've become a void and now I'm consuming myself, and I don't have the energy or the knowledge to stop it.  It doesn't help that I got depressing news today.

4165,dev_pid_4166,"Not sure whether to post in R depression R anxiety R social anxiety or R offmychest : I work in a cafe waiting on. Sometimes when I go up to tables, I can't say what I want to say, I structure my words completely wrong. This happens a lot when interacting with people I don't know well. The worst is when I'm asked a question which provokes an animated response, when they joke and I reply quietly, or with something that makes no sense. Very awkward for me.
I've started to notice that because I'm only working 1 day a week, I also do this with my coworkers. They don't often make conversation with me, since I inherently give off bad body language, I really don't mean to. I pretty much walk around with a guard either side of my eyes, always looking straight forward or as if I am distracted. I always have the assumption that the other staff joke about me, I feel like an outsider to the group (which also consists of returning customers). It's really difficult to fit in when I am like this.
I am very worried this is due to some unrelated events that have happened in the past. I think I am suffering from PTSD. 
I am hooked onto some thoughts about events that have been and gone. One of them involves grief, and without trying to get sympathy, is a very bad situation for someone to be part of. I will often use this thought along with others to conjure up a thought along the lines of ""If only other people understood"" - I think this is very bad, and I'm not sure what it implies for me. Maybe a personality disorder? Maybe I need to talk to someone about it?

4166,dev_pid_4167,"Caffeine alternatives to function albeit depression? : Hi! I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, tho my meds help me manage. The thing is, I'm pretty dependent on sources of caffeine to aid me in performing my responsibilities. The meds really work more as the shit that helps me get out of bed, but it doesn't extend as much to ""keep me rolling,"" especially with mentally-demanding tasks (as you know, our brains kinda bog down etc.). However, I'm trying so hard to get out of uni and shit, so I'm really doing my best to get everything done. In fact, I actually seem pretty ""high functioning"" because I do things that just helps me get shit done (assuming the stress isn't bringing out the worst of my MDD).
That said, would you have suggestions/accounts of things that keep you ""rolling"" to perform your tasks? I either go caffeine overload (coffee + energy drinks; going with just one of either isn't enough, has to be both) or just get depression naps. The latter doesn't sit well with me although it's really what my brain specifically ""needs"" considering the mental load my brain wears itself out from. I just lose 3 - 5 hours to those ""naps"" (this is apart from my lengthy night sleep) and it makes me feel emotionally shitty after that I've failed to do the task.

4172,dev_pid_4173,"Starting and titrating up on medication - Advice for those struggling : Hello everyone.
Just wanted to give some advice to those struggling as they start medication for the first time or are increasing their doses. Since I had a very bad experience with side effects my first time using medication, I thought it would be good to share my tips for getting through this rough period as I try meds again.
Basically, I have three pieces of advice:
1) Go slow. Even if the doctor says increase every 2 weeks, for example, don't blindly follow that if you're experiencing bad side effects. Take twice as long if you need to. When I tried doubling my dose every 2 weeks like the doctor (and official guidelines) recommended, it was hell most of the time. Racing thoughts, insomnia, lethargy, drowsiness, muscle aches, etc. etc. My second go-around with medication, I took twice as long between increases and experienced only mild side effects.
2) Tiny increases. Many doctors (and official guidelines) recommend start higher than you may be able to tolerate. If the prescription is for 10 mg, don't be afraid to start at half of one-quarter of that dose. Same goes for increases. Many doctors and guidelines suggest making 50-100% jumps per increase. When I did that, again, it was hell. But I didn't know better. Don't be afraid to use a pill cutter and make smaller increases as you go up in dosage.
3) Divide doses. If you start feeling wonky after taking a dose, try breaking it up and spreading it out over a few hours for a few weeks until your body gets used to it. There are many who divide their doses into AM and PM, and some who divide them even further. If you're experiencing horrible side effects, you're less likely to continue using medication, and even if you're resilient enough to ride out terrible side effects, why torture yourself and put your job, relationships, and happiness at risk? 
Finally, just listen to your body. Even if ""experts"" tell you one thing, if you're feel like garbage when taking medication, go slow or go small.",severe

The only thing really stopping me from talking to my parents, therapist or doctor about this is worrying about the cost for it happening. My parents already have to pay for so much shit that I’ve caused like my meds, therapy sessions, frequent doctor visits and that one emergency room fluke visit must have cost a shit ton even when all they did was give me a cold hamburger and took my blood.

After talking to people with major depression resistant to treatment who have recovered, I feel like I wanna move on. They had severe depression which had no relief, but they recovered. I start to think, I shouldn't have any insecure attachment or codependency issues. I can move on like them, even if my appointment is postponed 2.5 months. The other part of me is thinking, can I move on from having an insecure attachment style to my mum? I want to be mentally stable and go overseas to work, go to the countryside, explore the bustling city. I want to ride scary rollercoasters again without getting too anxious. There is life outside a hospital and constant outpatient appointments. Probably black and white thinking. Its not an either or thing. I was so ready to move on, I managed to stay on for months on my part-time jobs, things were going well. Like I knew I got to a point where I didn't have serious self harm urges or suicidal ideation. I felt like I was healed by God too. (Christianity). I hated some parts of my past, but I loved some parts of my past: the clubbing, the rollercoasters, the events which I went to. I hated being bullied or left out or failing academically. But I loved it when I could actually excel in the modules I loved, and I could write about cool stuff. I was so ready to break away from the identity and labels people have given to me. But there are some events and situations which will bring me to feeling useless again. And stupid. Like accountancy or being in a social setting where I don't feel welcome. Like I feel, how hard is it to wait 2.5 months for the next appointment? Just live my life and do shit even if I don't have much of an income right now and wait for ncov to tide over before finding new jobs?

4182,dev_pid_4183,"My battle with depression. : Hi all. This is my first real post on reddit. I had depression when I was younger. Under 10 I’m unsure of what age I was. Fast forward to 2016 I met this girl let’s call this person Beth. and my whole world changed. We had to secretly date cause her mother hated my guts. Some bipolar thing. I’m not sure. Anyway we were together and I kissed her and we were each other’s first. All the things. She moved up to New York to get away from her mom. She left a few days after my birthday. May 1st. I went and visited her a few times. I went in October then March then she came in may for my birthday. A failed surprise attempt. I’m always on top of the small clues. She went back a week later. She drove down for the summer like 18 hours of driving. I’m from Mississippi so it’s a fair distance. She came down, and it was clear she was not going back. We got engaged lives together had dogs, horses, chickens, cats, snakes, gerbils. All sorts of animals. We had a falling out one day and it all went down from there. She called my dad abusive all the time. She never met him, and was just going off what my mom said. That killed me inside because my dad died of a heart attack and the dog at the house ate part of his face off. So you can imagine how that made me feel. We had fights. We would get physical. I would try to calm things down and she would always jab at my dad which set me off. Let’s just say I didn’t take well to it. I always tried to make it up. We would bite, and punch. I wouldn’t hit her as hard as she hit me. I know I shouldn’t have anyway. I was filled with anger. I told her all my triggers and weaknesses. She used them against me constantly. We were in school for 2 year degrees. This last December she got her degree. She crashed her car so I had to get up early to take her to class. (She had earlier classes then me) no problem I did it without a second thought. After that we were getting evicted (we had till June to get our affairs set in order) she left and was back in New York before Christmas. I got fired from my job after this as well. So my life was terrible at this point. Fast forward to the 9th of January. She FaceTimes me crying. Ugly crying. She had slept with a guy and came to me because I had been her comfort the past 3.5 years. That was the first night I cut myself. Not to really kill myself, but to leave scars to remind me to never trust her again. I went to my care physician and she diagnosed me with Anxiety, Depression and PTSD. (Cause of my dad I’m guessing) I got put on Bupropion 150xl. I take 2 a day. Before all this he said she wanted to be friends but then turned everything back on me. It was all my fault, and I was the problem. I loved this girl. Took care of her singlehanded for 3 months while she get a job, and In school. I fixed her car twice. So now here I am writing this post. Class is hard, and I’m having trouble. I’ve tried meeting new people, but it doesn’t work. I have 7 dating apps and nothing. I am very discouraged and lonely. I miss the dogs. A few weeks ago the one we got together got ran over and she didn’t even tell me. That hurt so much. Her cousin told me at 2 am in the morning. (Beth does not have contact. She blocked me everywhere) to top it off she got her new dude to text me saying “We need to have a talk” that was the most childish thing ever. Spring break just got extended and I feel as my world is just falling apart. I have no social life. Playing video games used to be fun. Now I just find myself laying in bed scrolling through Facebook or IFunny. Even these dating apps. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing at all. I got to my one friends house just so I’m not alone. I had to move back in with my grandma after all this. I had to move of of the house. Fridge. Washer/dryer. Hot water heater. Bed. Dishwasher. All the dishes and pots/pans I bought. Everything.

I've taken celexa, prozac, effexor, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, and seroquel. The one I've taken the longest and had probably the best experience is prozac, but it makes me terribly tired and sort of dulls me out.

The one I'm on now is called Wellbutrin which is more of a stimulant (which is why I was switched to this one) but it makes me feel angry and impatient even though it's the one that worked the best out of the two.

The last two weeks of the depression was basically being on autopilot. This is actually called depersonalization disorder. When situation gets too stressful your mind begins to cope with it as if it were watching it from a different perspective, hence the term autopilot   During that time I quit smoking and had to be determined to make some changes emotionally and mentally. I’m really big on not letting emotions control you because I believe our emotions lie to us. But the weird thing about it is depression is not an emotion it is actually a situational thing.

Tell me why, I still feel pain when imagining you moved on. Tell me why I can’t do the same? Tell me, just please tell me why we couldn’t work it out. Why it had to be so final. Why I run back to you every time you cut out my heart and throw it to the gutter. Why do I like me better when I’m with you? Why am I so broken?
Every time I get like this I try to write a song to help me feel better. I hoped in some cruel way I could make money off the pain. Be known for hauntingly beautiful but depressing music. I dreamed of seeing you right up front of one of my concerts, and being able to sing my heart out to you. So you’d know just how much you hurt. Petty, right?
Ultimately, I know I’m broken. And I’m trying so hard to fix myself. But every mention of you throws me back into that pit, drowning in my own foolish love.",severe

4195,dev_pid_4196,My first time doing something like this : I've been struggling with depression for 8 years now. It really started when my grandfather died unexpectedly in his sleep. Let me add that my mom had me young so my grandfather was only 56 at the time. His death crushed me as he was honestly once if my best friends also . I saw him every single day including the day before his passing. To this day it still hurts so much. It has had a huge impact on my life I started drinking heavily. At 1 point the drinking was so bad I almost lost my girlfriend. I have since stopped drinking and me and my girlfriend are engaged but as I plan my wedding I get down bc I know he won't be able to see it.

4197,dev_pid_4198,"A Rant that I Made in 10/5/19 (Ive Gotten Better) : Why is depression even a thing? It's such a terrible thing. I makes tons of people kill themselves, sometimes without a reason. I had and still have depression. I know what it feels like or the general feeling of it. For me, it came out of nowhere. Maybe not nowhere but I dont know what caused it exactly. I can just guess maybe it was because I moved to a new state and am not a socialable person, so I just felt lonely or what. Or maybe it was because of my ""dad."" I honestly dont know, but I'm not here to talk about how I got my depression I'm hear to explain what it's done to me and many others. Some of the people I look up to have had depression like Suga (BTS) and Sultan Sketches. And mainly that's that reason I look up to them. They have lived through it and I hope I can to. Now a few days ago I broke. I cried and I seriously thought about killing myself. I've been better since then but still because of depression my personality got more conserved and shy. I mean I was shy before but never this shy. I avoid talking to people because I'm afraid I might do something they dont like or intrude on them. Like I dont want to make other people feel like being around me is a chore for them, so I just dont talk to others. I mean if I say something, I might offend them or just get to close to them just to be a third wheel. Trust me I've been the third wheel of many many friend groups. I would just be in the back following them and listening to them as they talk, but never saying anything. I have had some friends that I really connected with. Those great friends should be enough for me especially when I have such loving aunts, uncles, grandparents, and parents. But I still feel so lonely. I feel like I cant tell anyone about my depression because it would only burden them. You see I cant talk about other people's depression, but mine literally tells me I'm inferior to everyone, I dont deserve anything, and I'm always bothering others. This means I think thoughts about how this other girl is smarter than me and another person in nice than me. I want to die, but dont deserve that. So, I shouldn't pass on my sins to others and be peaceful when I'm dead, while they suffer. I dont deserve the peace. Lastly, the bothering others one means I dont talk to others because they dont like talking to me, I dont ask for help because that means I'm taking up someone's valuable time forcing them to help me out of kindness, pity, or just to help out their persona. Anyway I need to sleep. Oh yeah, so depression also made me depend on anime (wow such weeb) to essentially run away from my problems and or depression because it introduces me to another world for a few minutes and I'm only thinking about that world and not mine. This is why I gravitate toward books, movies, and anime that are action, romance, or sometimes comedy based. It also made me lazy (*lazier) by not giving me the will to do other things, helps (not a good thing) me procrastinate more because honestly I just want to go back to watching that amazing anime (I have an anime watched list. Dont judge) so I can be happier and forget about my problems. I'm such a coward, running away from my depression instead of facing it head on. That's probably why my depression left for like 3 months (not completely) then knocked on my door and said, ""Guess who's back??? Depression's back.""

So rough, in fact, that i quit my job of 3 years, burned through my savings, kill my credit, and checked myself into a mental hospital for a few days. The doctor there diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and prescribed some meds.
I took the meds for awhile and jumped from shitty minimum wage job to shitty minimum wage job. I was only staying at these places of employment for a few days then id quit. I found the meds were just making my moods worse and i stopped taking them, and moved back in with my parents. I found a decent job that i held for 9 months and actually met my current girlfriend there. That was a hard time in my life, but i got through it.
Cut now to 2020, my girlfriend and i have loved together since july 2019 and we're really happy together. Recently ive been feeling the depression come back and i dont know why. I quit my job where i was making 50k a year to take a few months off. I burned through the little bit of cash i had in my savings and now have to get back to working. 
I have a job lined up, not a great job, but it'll definitely pay the bills. The thought if going back to work is crippling to me. I know i have to hop back to work to support my girlfriend and i, but it's a hard mental block fit me to get over and I'm scared I'm just gonna quit again. 
I went back to the doctor to try different medication, but after taking it for a month my girlfriend told me it made me paranoid and she didnt like who i was when i took it.
Kind of a subject change, but bare with me it's all relevant:
In july of 2019 i had just quit the job i worked at for 9 months. To pay bills i had to sell all of my guitars. Ive played guitar since i was 8 years old and was actually in a touring band for 5 years. My band isnt together anymore so selling the guitars was a no brainer, i had to support us. It was still one of the hardest things id ever done. I hadnt played in awhile and thought it wouldnt bother me too much, but it fucking killed me. 
I feel music has defined very much of who i am. In my band i played guitar, sang and wrote all of our songs. I felt attached to my instruments. My girlfriend is also a musician and has a guitar around the house that ive been rediscovering my passion on. I feel pathetic because i feel uncomfortable playing her guitar. She always says ""honey, we share everything it's your guitar too"", but, and i hope this doesnt sound shitty, i take playing guitar a lot more seriously than she does so i feel sad and awkward not having my own guitar.
She works at a national guitar retailer and gets a killer discount. She convinced me i need to get my own guitar again and i agreed, but the problem is we arent financially at a point where we can do that. She still ordered the guitar i wanted to the store and put it on layaway for a few months, but i dont feel like I'll ever be able to pay it off. 
My old drummer is coming home to visit in may and we are trying to get a show booked, but I'm scared for some reason it wont happen. We have a really good presence in our area cus we played here for 5 years, and again not to sound like an ass, but we always brought a decently sized crowd. Every venue in the area is booked. We decided we wanna play a show in our old studio, we've played 10 shows there, we didnt think our studio manager would care, but when we asked him he said ""I'll have to think about it"" which is fine it's his studio i totally understand that, but I'm still a little disappointed.
To make matter worse, we have to get half this guitar paid off before i can take it home. With only one month between now and the show,  my job not starting for another week, and all the bills we have to catch up on, it feels like I'll never get to play music again. 
My one creative outlet and the thing that means so much to me, i feel like I'll never get to do again. I feel completely hopeless. Of course the most important thing in my life shifted from muisic to my girlfriend and our small fanily of animals, so i feel guilty for trying to make my music a priority and all. I just sit and think about me and my best friends opening old shows with ""Tubthumping"" and the crowd singing along and having a great time and i just dont think I'll ever get to recapture that feeling again and ah fuck ive started crying as i type this out.
Sorry this post is so long. I feel hopeless and it's all over dumb stuff. Like who gives a fuck that I'll never play music again, or at least for a long long time. Who cares that i feel like i cant hold a steady job and dont know why. It's selfish of me to want to put myself first at all and i feel really dumb that i even typed all this out. I just dont feel like i have anyone to talk to.

I think some of it is because my life circumstances are horrible and some of it is just because I have depression and a bunch of other chronic illnesses. I can’t really do anything about either problem bc I’m completely overwhelmed and I have basically no support. 
Whenever I try to address my terrible life circumstances, it backfires and they get much much worse. I’m in grad school and it’s absolutely awful right now and I can’t leave and when I try to talk to advisors, deans, ombudsmen, etc their “help” is next to useless, sometimes talking to them makes the problem even worse than before. I’m completely dependent on grad school for income, health insurance, etc and I’m so physically and emotionally exhausted that I don’t even have the capacity to look for a different job. I’m honestly so incapacitated by depression that I don’t really think I can work at all but I’m not even sure that I can go on disability right now.
I have a lot of health problems that are poorly managed and basically no support for those either. I keep telling my doctors that I feel awful and have zero quality of life and they mostly just ignore me, tell me I’m a hypochondriac and there’s nothing wrong, treat me like a human scab and talk to me like a house pet. My therapist and psychiatrist keep telling me how “great” I’m doing and when I ask them where they get this idea that I’m doing great they won’t answer. I keep repeatedly, urgently telling them that I feel terrible and they basically just tell me that I’m fine and I don’t need anything. 
I don’t know what to do. Normally when you’re having a problem at work, you talk to the people at work about that problem and they help you. Normally when you have a medical problem, you talk to a doctor and they help you. I don’t even have the support of my family right now bc they keep talking about how “great” I’m doing and how I’m “so much better.” Whenever I say that I don’t feel better, I actually feel worse they just tell me that I’m stressed and that I’ll feel better once I take a vacation.
How the fuck am I supposed to make my life better if ALL of my support systems are offering me no support? Everyone says “ask for help when you need it” when someone is considering suicide, but here I am repeatedly asking for help and being told I don’t need it and nothing’s wrong.

4213,dev_pid_4214,"[SS] I’m currently going through a hard point in my life. One of those, “I have a good life, why am I sad?”. I’ve been here before, with more valid reasons. Angst (concern of future and present), has been developing into depression (concern of the past, and indifference). Scratching to stay above. : **looking for peer support, kind words, and help.** scheduling an apt with my therapist ASAP. 
This will sound scrambled, but. I don’t have it as bad as some people here. I’m not suicidal. Nothing horrible has happened to me. It’s more of that, subtle baseline sadness that you can’t shake.
 I'm just sitting here by myself bawling and the idea of spending time with people is so unappealing to me. And that's just not me. It's horrible. I had an anxiety attack last week where I came close to passing out and I hyperventilated- which is usual. But I just haven't been able to bounce back since. The panic attack occurred because I was attempting to build my core, as I was on schedule to have a surgery that would improve my quality of life on 3/25 (cancelled since covid19). 
I just feel like I'm drowning, but I have nothing to drown in. And I'm just continuing to try and try and try to pull myself out of it but I keep getting bogged back down like a fishing bobble. Things keep pulling me under. Nothing in particular, but nothing is bringing me pure happiness as it has before.
I live in an area that **has the most greyest days and cloud coverage in all of the US**. It’s just gloomy. No sun. On warm days, it’s still overcast. Typically I’ve combatted seasonal depression with welbutrin, vitamins and tanning. I have avoided tanning, as it’s at my gym and once again, social distancing due to COVID 19. 
Anxiety is in the air but in conjunction with that. Anxiety to me is the fear of the future or what's going on. To me. And depression is negative reflection on how bad things were/are. And I just don't want to see my friends lately, and have no desire to do so. And like, i like those people and I'm social to some extent.
I just feel like if I stop cleaning, or moving that I'm actually going to fall into staying in my bed all day depression. And it scares me how close I am to that.
And I feel even worse, because I do have a really good life with good people. I can't explain why I feel this way. It just feels like nothing is as bright as it use to be and it hurts. And I feel like I've been a bad friend to my close friends and I hate it. I feel like I haven't been available for them. I have pregnant friends, long distance friends, who all have reached out, sent me gifts and “thinking of you”. Countlessly reach our to me. And I reiterate, “hey I’m not mentally there today, but please don’t stop inviting me out. I appreciate the invite”.",severe

I touched on the obsessive need to control my environment, and how it drives
My fiancé mad, to never stop moving, relaxing, or taking care of myself- in the sense of things I enjoy.
I’m at the point where my fiancé is my rock. He’s expressed he needs to be able to take care of himself, too. So he can remain strong for me as I crumble. Plus I never want to go to the watering hole too many times and dry it out. I feel the same way about my friends. My best friend told me almost a decade  ago, “you only call when you have a problem”. I’ve since then never really call anymore when I have an issue. Sometimes. Plus I started calling for other reasons. For my family, I don’t want to give them more problems than they have. But they listen when I do talk to them about it. Just that feeling of being a burden. 
Here’s my obsessive cleaning issue that stems from it and drives my fiancé crazy because I’m a dick about it-

People are either really busy, or arn't really interesting in anything I haves to say. I gotten used to it, being alone you know. Taught me to watch people, and learn emotions and such. 
However.. there comes that price of feeling of worth and self worth is not being there. Or having any real value to anyone really. I tried to commit suicide a few weeks ago due to PTSD, and years of just guilt and loneliness building up. I got that one friend and then lost that one friend because i am fucked in the head from growing up without any real social group to be in. 
I did get called 911 after my mother saw how many pills I took at once and me just drolling on the floor passing out. I was put in Impatience for awhile about 3 weeks. Worked with some clinician and I did felt like I was supported, and liked. All the doctors that heard my story, and my experiences. I was told I had a big heart, a very big heart. Which I have a hard time believing in because of the things I done, and the things I couldn't fight back on. 
I guess another big part of my feelings is that I could never forgive myself, i couldn't forgive myself for not being able to fight back being sexually assaulted, I often feel like it wouldn't matter since I am male, and males are viewed a invulnerable, but it simply isn't true. I remember seeing terrors of people's eyes, and alot of haunting memories that just fucks with me. 
Anyway i do hang out with this group at school and when I just vanished for 3 weeks. No one asked the question of what happened to me, it was like I was a ghost. It really got me thinking if I really mattered or not. 
I get people do care about me, and I am able to do great things. I get the crap, but... I still just wanna be able to have friends.. like actually friends that can try to work through my bullshit I am trying to work on. And accept me for who I am.

I've been with my husband over 11 years. Last year he was diagnosed in his 30s with severe ADHD. Last week he was also diagnosed with bipolar. We've been living separately for about 6 weeks. I haven't told anyone other than my counselor.
Obviously things were spiraling badly for us to get to this point. He never physically hurt me but was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive. It felt like only a matter of time.
I used to self harm and have passive suicidal ideation frequently, which my counselor is aware of.
My partner says he wants to get help and is set to start cognitive behavioral therapy and medication next weekish. 
This whole journey really started 2 years ago when I couldn't take his mothers shitty treatment of me anymore and our friend killed himself and I asked him to get counseling.
Now here we are 2 years later, all these changes and resources and everything still sucks so much. I can't even tell my family. They have their own issues and lives and are across the country.
Now another friend committed suicide over Christmas and all I can think about is what a miserable piece of shit I am with a miserable life and how nice it would be not to live it anymore.
I'm just really down over it all. I tried to be a friend to my partner but I think he just hates me. He lives in our detached garage and I don't know why he treats me the way he does.

4228,dev_pid_4229,"Fuck hope. : I’m tired of hope.  I’m tired of excitement.  I keep on getting excited about things in my life and I keep getting let down.  I’m just fucking tired of it.
For some backstory, I have autism spectrum disorder severity 2 (moderate), ADHD, a learning disorder, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and a few other things aside from those.  The greatest hits parade.  I always knew I was autistic, and had this confirmed by a few psychiatrists, but never a formal diagnosis.  That is, until a month ago.  I finally managed to get an appointment with a great establishment that did assessments for free.  I walked in with just depression and anxiety on my official transcript and walked out with that whole laundry list.  None of it was a surprise, really.  After telling me the diagnosis, the Dr. expressed a lot of concern over how symptoms as severe as mine should have been handled starting when I was very young.  She had no idea how I had survived 26 years like this, and expressed that she wanted to get started with treatment ASAP.  I was super excited.  For the first time I’d start getting real answers and real help.  She said they’d get in contact with me about scheduling an appointment as soon as they could.  
A couple of days go by.  I’m still excited, I can’t wait to find out when my first appointment will be.  
A week goes by.  I’m starting to get upset and confused.  They said we couldn’t wait even a week to get started.  What’s wrong?
Two weeks.  I’m angry.  I’ve given up hope.  I don’t care anymore, and I don’t want to talk about it.
Finally, they get back to me.  And the appointment will be another two weeks away.  I was crestfallen.  But at least I knew when it would be.
Fast forward to today, the day before the appointment.  Finally, finally I would have the chance to talk to someone who understands me, I can be myself without fearing ridicule, I can talk to someone without feeling inferior.  I’m so excited.  Until I get an email saying all appointments are cancelled for the next two weeks because of the coronavirus.
Why do I do this to myself every time?  And why does it always happen to me in particular?  Within the past three years, I could count on a single hand how many times I’ve been excited for something and that thing actually even happened, not even taking into account whether it lived up to expectations or not.  Everything I get excited about falls through.  Every time I’m hopeful I get let down.  It feels like life is a kid crouched by an anthill on a sunny day with a magnifying glass and I’m its favorite ant to torture.
I’m so ready to give up.  I thought I was days away from starting my journey to getting the help and services I needed FINALLY, after 26 years of suffering, and yet even now, life finds a way to keep pushing the light at the end of the tunnel further and further back.  I guess I should expect them to extend the period they’re canceling appointments even longer than two weeks.

4231,dev_pid_4232,"When the medical system couldn’t seem to figure out what was wrong with me, I sort of gave up : I was odd growing up. A funny odd, that got along with most people. I had friends in high school, but kind of pushed them away because I loved hockey too much. I trained all the time, and looking back it was a great escape for me. I had such bad anxiety, but there’s no discrimination on the ice, and I was simply the best. I felt invincible. The only thing I wanted in life was to win a state championship, and I dragged my team to a good seed in the tournament my junior year. But going into it I got my first concussion. I played through it because my whole life goal was in front of me, then I got another one. Then my senior I got two more. Then in college I got one, and played through it until things got... bad...
So I have “recovered” from all my concussions and am now dealing with post-concussion syndrome in my junior year of college. My memory tested as severely impaired, I can’t put words to my thoughts, and my anxiety is stupid bad. I cannot even be in a car when I’m not driving, as my heart will literally be pounding the entire time. 
So the only thing I’ve ever truly loved is hockey, I cannot play that anymore and no coach likes me enough to have me help them. I’ve never built good relationships with head coaches, because I’ve always been so close to defensive coaches. I’m honestly a ridiculously smart hockey mind, but that means absolutely nothing once you stop playing. So now what I’ve worked on my entire life means nothing. I forget what I’m doing at least 4-5 times a day. I use Waze to get to places that I’ve been to thousands of times. I miss several doctors appointments and forget to schedule so many. My parents and siblings treat it as a joke because I look fine. I have limited skills for the outside world, and honestly haven’t cared nearly enough about finding an internship. I’m tired all day, in part because I’m depressed and in part because of my head. I can sleep for a long time... much longer than the average person. I was robbed at gunpoint earlier this year and literally forget what happened and the DA is constantly bugging me about that situation. My friends only liked me because I was fun to drink with. Now that I can’t drink they do not like me. I have found more friends that I’m more comfortable with, but telling them this a few months into a friendship would be a great way to end up with no friends. I have IBS so my stomach is constantly tossing and turning. The only thing that settles it is weed, but my parents would murder me if I ever got caught with it. I used to smoke fake carts, but now I don’t really because I’m afraid of vitamin E oil. The gym is my only escape because I can’t play the sport that I love. The gym is now shut down for Coronavirus concerns. Ever since I got home from break the only thing I found wholesome in life are my two cats. One I knew didn’t have a whole lot of time left, but suddenly took a major turn and looks like she has maybe a couple weeks. The other was supposed to live for like idk, five more years. Today I woke up and she has paralysis in her back legs. Like WTF.

I used SSRIs for a couple years and experienced some benefit, though never achieved full remission. Due to the emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, among other side effects, I decided to quit. 
~ 4 years later, I'm still fucked up from the drugs. I suffer from anhedonia, decreased libido, head pressure, among other symptoms. The original anxiety is still present -- perhaps more so -- with an additional later of drug-induced depression added to the mix.

I'm 20 years old, had to drop out of college after one year because I'm too poor, have been working an extremely dead-end job for the past six months and just don't know what to fucking do anymore.
I went to college for one year but had to drop out because I couldn't afford it. I have zero friends, and my job is overnights for 10 hours, four days on four days off and only pays minimum wage. I'm male and I work with five ladies who are all each over 40 so there's zero fucking connection between them and me. I don't have a car yet so I'm still stuck at this job for at least another couple of months until I can get one because I'm getting carpooled right now. My only friend moved to Mississippi a few years back and we've been growing more distant and hardly have anything in common anymore. When I'm not at work the only thing I want to do is sleep and I get very little enjoyment out of activities that I used to love, and on days I don't work it's hard to force myself to do anything. My parents are poor so they can't afford to put me on their health insurance and I can't afford it myself. 
The one thing I had to look forward to was a vacation to Portland that I've been planning for over six months, but now due to all this Coronavirus bullshit I have to reschedule. I can reschedule my plane tickets but my AirBnB was booked outside of the refund date so there's $300 down the fucking drain.

I was at a stage where the only thing that calmed me was knowing the end was coming, I was counting down the days. I cleaned out my belongings, I wanted to make things easier for my parents. 
With four days to go I panicked, what if I wasn’t successful? So many thoughts running through my head. A trip to the ER and I found myself in a psych facility. Diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, bipolar and PTSD and a mixed cocktail of medication I left three weeks later. 
It’s been five weeks since I was discharged and I still feel so fucking dead on the inside. I don’t sleep. I struggle to leave the house. I have zero interest in anything. I don’t function. I don’t know who I used to be before any of this, I’m lost. 
I need to see a psychologist but I the thought of bringing up some of the things I’ve been bottling up inside is terrifying. Past trauma consumes me, I want to let go but I just can’t.

4253,dev_pid_4254,"What do I even do at this point? : Long story short, 29 year old man, elementary school teacher, war veteran, severe depression and mild PTSD since I was 5 or 6 from prolonged childhood trauma, been in therapy half my life, failed 24+ different antidepressants as well as TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) therapy.  My life has been horrible throughout these almost 3 decades, but I've managed to make something of myself; I have a legitimate bootstrap story - grew up poor and abused, abandoned by my dad, joined the military to get away from all that, etc and still grew up to become the first homeowner in my family at 24 (this is a huge feat for American millennials).  I still own the same house, I drive a fun car, I'm very talented, I have good friends, and I have a good job.  I'm also tall and well-built, not bad to look at, fairly healthy and athletic, and have a full head of hair, all of which is a lot more than a lot of my peers can say.
And yet, I am in so much unbearable pain that I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  I finally beat alcoholism a few months ago, but I've had multiple suicide attempts over the last 10 years.  Literally nothing makes me happy and I am constantly fighting tears and aggressive suicidal urges.  I space out (dissociate) at work so much that I just got demoted for poor performance and have been caught staring at random people without realizing.  I am a constant source of worry for my friends and family, and I am a constant burden on my bosses and coworkers.  That's not the depression talking.
I've wanted to die for years.  I don't want to get married or have kids or any of that.  I don't want to work.  I don't want to go on vacations.  I just want to die so the agony can stop.  I don't want to hurt anyone, I just want the pain to go away.  The memories and the pain are just unbearable and living with them has rendered life devoid of dignity and enjoyment.  The tiniest things make me explode while the big things leave me apathetic.  I just don't care about anything anymore.
I go to therapy weekly, but I'm pretty sure my therapist doesn't know what to do with me anymore (I've had therapists and psychiatrists tell me that before).  I feel like something inside is broken or missing.  I can't enjoy life or connect with new people.  My only states of mind are annoyed and relieved.  I don't want to be here anymore and haven't in a long time.  But my suicide would destroy my mom, who has been through too much in life.  I can't do that to her even if I'm starting not to care anymore.  
What do I do?  Is it just always going to be like this?  I don't remember what happiness feels like.  I'm always either numb or so sad/angry that I want to cry but can't.  I feel like a ghost wandering the Earth, detached from this plane yet still connected by a snagged thread.

My father was never in the picture. At age 7 my mom had a new boyfriend and from ages 10-13 he sexually harassed me, molested me, and verbally abused me; calling me ugly, etc. When I told my mom, she kicked him out; but I suppose my child subconscious hid the fact that he shortly after came back. I’ve been suffering depression ever since. Low self esteem, antisocial behavior, miserable. It wasn’t until my late teens that I’d remembered what happened and why I was like this. 
Fast forward to age 25- I suffered a mental breakdown once being severely depressed for months. I was in a manic state for about a months time. Hospitalized twice within that month. A time in which my subconscious decided to reveal something else eating at me. I remembered that At age 11 I’d sexually abused my half brother which was 7 at the time (he has another father) I feel sick. I feel like a monster. I also realize though that this was a result of the environment I was in but can’t help but blame myself anyway. 
My mom is still with my “stepfather” and they have two sons. Brothers whom I have to pretend I’m okay because they don’t know what he did to me. Everyone that knows pretends it never happened. While I suffer silently and feel as if under water slowly drowning.

I'm 20 and have fit the criteria for depression since I was 16 I would say. I have experienced: Low mood, loss of interest in almost all activities I used to enjoy, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts (not often). The suicidal thoughts tend to occur more in the winter time, in the summer months I actually feel a bit better. I guess the main symptom is chronic apathy and hopelessness. 
It was rather manageable until October last year when I discovered some disturbing news that I was adopted and that my biological father was a serial rapist who raped my biological mother. After finding this out I feel I have become a little ""nutty"". My girlfriend became especially worried, as I would always pick fights with her and in her words ""become rather unstable"". I wouldn't say I have become delusional, but I now very quickly assume the worst in people and spiral into a very bitter place at the slightest wrong doing. 
I just want some advice with what to say. I don't really like talking about my issues with strangers, it just feels really uncomfortable - like I am somehow showing weakness. This applies especially as I am a man. Another thing that scares me is talk of antidepressants. On the one hand I feel I could benefit from such a medication as a tool to get things going again, however the side effects also make me anxious. The loss of libido scares me, mainly the horror stories I hear of it never coming back after cessation. However what scares me more is the emotional hollowness a lot of people describe, that when they do feel happiness its somehow ""meh"". I still feel really happy sometimes, but its very rare and temporary, and I don't want those moments to feel less special.

Lotsa hormones flying around everywhere atm due to it being that time of the month, plus on new antidepressants for 4 days. Dont feel like self care is helping yet.
So a little back ground. Suffered with very bad anxiety and depression for 30 years. I'm going through atm a tough and super busy period of my life atm where i am studying part time a very intensive course called access to criminology and law (its essentially 2 years of A levels in 10months), working part time at starbucks, planning my finacè and I's wedding, trying to lose weight so we can get ivf (need to lose 3 stone, stuck at 1 stone 12lb), look after our house, and be a good finacè and parent to my 6 Y/O daughter from a previous relationship.
Needless to say i'm stressed, i've started to recognise my symptoms, so i know before i'm gonna have a really rough patch where i cant leave the house i start to feel just numb. Things that should upset me etc, just dont i feel nothing. So i went to my doctor who gave me some anti depressants and a note saying please give me more time with my college assignments.

Every medication of the 9ish I've tried has had no effect, and I mean none literally. I've also gotten absolutely nowhere with therapy, I even tried a couple different therapists this year, because I was told that if you aren't getting anywhere with your therapist it might just be because you don't mesh with them.

Although I know it's because of them, I can't get myself to stop hating myself because of mean people. It became a part of me.

I just went eh it's okay, but then I was going through a bad time and I noticed that I had to start every conversation with him, and that he steadily started ignoring me. We used to play games together, but I noticed he stopped playing with me and stopped talking to all his friends all together and only focused on his girlfriend which I understand. The problem is he started being meaner for no reason and questioning everything I said. I found myself sad again and crying daily for a total of now a month. I'm crying as I'm writing this portion, I thought he was a good friend, I thought I had someone to rely on when I'm sad. He helped me through a lot and we told each other everything.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for three weeks in a row now, and I can't bring myself to ask for help from my friends.

4281,dev_pid_4282,"Been depressed for a long time and not sure how to get out of it : I've had issues since my time in the service but they got worse after my wife admitted to having an affair and walked out about a year ago. I did the normal self pity party, crying, no sleep, barely eating, drinking too much, etc  (still kinda do that) but even after I started to wise up nothing seems to go right. Everything I do seems to backfire on me some way.
My best friend walked out on me, I left my closest friends besides her when I got out of the military, my family has always been the type where we don't talk about emotions, and the 2 people I've actually opened up to since she left ended up talking shit behind me back and laughing about me.
Job wise I don't really have any marketable skills in the private sector, cant find a job that pays more than minimum wage. I'm staying with family right now but I cant seem to save up any money because whenever I do something happens, either my truck breaks down or my ex is asking me to pay for her latest speeding ticket, her groceries, gas, etc and for whatever reason I give her the cash.  I mean I know why I do it, it's because I love her. We've had rough times in the past and when we were broke and barely scrapping by, there were days I didn't eat to make sure my daughters and her had enough.
I just want something good to happen or at least something I know how to handle. I've been applying for jobs with miltary contracters in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan so that I can at least have a decent paying job that makes sense (I've worked in factories, construction, private security, agriculture and had a hard time adjusting. My transition out of the service wasn't as smooth as I would have liked and was part of the problem with my relationship.)
So what the hell should I do?

4284,dev_pid_4285,"How a near death experience worsened my depression : Trigger warning, very descriptive of my frame of mind. 
Last summer, after tubing at my lake, I was swimming around when I got very cold. I figured it was because I hadn’t eaten yet that day so I got out of the water and started to walk up the stone steps to my porch. I was still really cold but my legs began to grow so heavy that I couldn’t stand. I collapsed on the steps and my body was now on fire, bursting into hives that made the rest of my skin shrink in on itself. I remember my mom dragging me up the stone steps and standing me up next to our grill while she went to get Benadryl, I don’t remember fainting or hitting my head on the grill. But I did. I eventually came to half consciousness about five minutes later, unable to move, talk, or even hear. The heavy heat had lifted but there was this cold left behind. I felt so light and my nerves were coated in a sort of darkness that blinded them. I couldn’t hear anything but a slight ringing and some white static. Later, my mom would tell me my stepdad was shaking me and calling my name while she was patting my face. She also said that I was nearly completely blue and barely breathing, that she would have started CPR soon. She thought I was going to die. But all of that means nothing to me compared to what I saw. They don’t lie when they say there’s a light. Granted it wasn’t warm, nothing was actually. But it was beautiful. At first just the sun, but then after filtering through green leaves directly above me, it became this rippled net of picturesque peace. I remember thinking that if this was it, if this was how I died, after doing the last thing I loved, looking up at leaves, that would be ok. In that moment, I truly wanted to die. And it’s odd because recovery units and suicidal pamphlets tell us that we just want the pain to be gone. So much so that dying seems like the only way out. They make it seem like we wish for some paradise on the other side where chaos is nonexistent. But they’re wrong. Before this incident I was already diagnosed with severe OCD and MDD. Medicated for both. All the coping mechanisms. All the positive mental attitude. All the medication and therapy, couldn’t have saved me from death. They say none of us are meant to die at our own hands. I disagree. I think that some of us wander this Earth dying a little everyday, knowing there is no point. No end. So what of this one that people found horrific? Death was no end, it is completion.
I go back to this incident often. In some sick way it comforts me. The idea of being able to rest eternally after the war that is my mind. I don’t have a bad life. Many people would kill to have my life. And I still wish they could take it. But I’m still going, because I know that, one way or another, I’ll get there.",severe

4287,dev_pid_4288,"It finally happened, my libido is gone : I've been taking Paxil (paroxetine) for a while now. Started with 10mg and now I've climbed all the way up to 50mg over 2 years, where I managed to find some peace. I tried going down to 40mg but my life got a bit disastrous so I went back up to 50mg. After a while, I was out of pills so I had my psychiatrist prescribe me more.
Except this time the pharmacy was out of Paxil 20mg/pill, so they gave me an equivalent medication of a different brand, which had a dose of 40mg/pill. I already have some Paxil left over so I'm using half a Paxil (10mg) + this Paxil substitute (40mg) for a total of 50mg of paroxetine.
For some reason this change made things better even though the dose was the same. It felt like I was taking a higher dose. I made sure to double-check the numbers and they did sum up to 50mg. But I started sleeping for 12 hours a day. I started feeling nothing looking at revealing clothing. I tried all kinds of suggestive images and I would get no response. It's as if I became asexual overnight. It really hurt my overall happiness because it was a way of stress relief for me.
This happened about 1 week after I started taking Paxil along with its substitute so I'm definitely sure the culprit is either the substitute or the simultaneous use of the two.
I know the internet isn't the best place for medical advice but I was wonder if someone had a similar experience. My next appointment is over 2 months later. Even if it was sooner, I doubt I would be able to talk about my sexual life because I'm single and I don't know what I'm supposed to say. ""Help, I can't masturbate!"" would leave a weird impression.
Anyways, thanks for reading so far. I'll keep taking my meds because I have no other alternative and I don't wanna get the brain zaps and other withdrawal symptoms. I just hope this lack of libido or SSRI induced ED isn't a permanent thing.

Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.
There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.
So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.
I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.
Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.
It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.
But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.
So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly.

I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact).

I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.
So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly.

I tried to end it all when I was in hs and told myself I would never go back to that place. I decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and I’m glad I did. I won’t bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it.

I know I will be happy there, more so than this place. And I’ll be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short 4 years. I’m hoping this was the change that I was looking for. I made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. I start next month!

I will turn 30 soon and I have been addicted to porn since I was 12. I used porn as a safe coping mechanism so that I wouldn't have to deal with anything in life- improving social skills and having friendships, taking risks, developing hobbies, talking to girls and dating, going to college, traveling. Ive done none of these things. I've had a few menial jobs and have an apartment. That's it.
Now I have no job, I am a virgin and I have no friends. I just quit watching porn a month ago, but I am more depressed than I have ever been. This is because when I cut my coping mechanism being porn addiction out of your routine, reality hit me like a brick wall. Everything is bubbling to the surface and I am fully overwhelmed by the fact that I have completely wasted my young life. I see absolutely no positive reason to move forward. I have never felt this close to suicide being the only way out before. I am seeing shrinks about my problems and got put on meds recently this month. Therapy is not helping and you know meds just numb the pain a bit. They don't do anything to improve me without me trying to improve myself. But it's gotten to the point where I have no desire to improve myself AT ALL!! I can't get out of bed, can't eat. can't go outside. I have no passion to do anything. I know I can't commit suicide but I don't want to move or think. 
I've been in a crisis unit at a local hospital 5 years ago and it did nothing to help me. All they did was put me on zoloft and made me sit in a bed and attend group meetings with drug addict for 2 weeks straight before they released me. All this did for me was numb the pain with medication and I was just as unhappy as I was before I went in. 
So my question is what happens when you don't want to kill yourself, but you can't deal with digging yourself out of this rock bottom state? Is there a place where they will put you where you don't have to leave your bed? Psych ward or something?  I want to be put away forever. I can't deal with the uphill battle I will have to face in life and my regrets and hopelessness is way too strong to battle anymore. I do not have any strength left to improve myself at all.

In some ways, I felt like a completely different person; I became more empathetic, my grades went up, I had more motivation then maybe ever before, I completely stopped doing self harm, including pinching, which is something I started doing as a form of self harm when I was around 8, but I was still me in the sense of personality.

As I'm writing this I finally realized I probably need professional help but for some reason, I'm fighting myself over whether I should reach for help or not. I'm not comfortable with asking for help, I always love to be the one helping. Though I guess theres a small part of me hoping that someone would reach out, despite the fact that I try so hard to hide my true struggle with my emotions and act like I'm laid back and have no care in the world.
I'm always going against what I need. I want a way out of my counter-productive mindset. Its ruining my school/work and my aspiration to achieve what I want in my life.
A few years ago I was upset how I couldnt find any love interest. But as time passed I grew to realize that's not what I really wanted. So I took up some hobbies, which until recently also have lost their ability to give me joy. And even my long term life goals arent making me any happier. Theres nothing I want or hate. I'm just sad and empty.",severe
4335,dev_pid_4336,"Impulsive self harm : Hi everyone. I'm 24f and I have a mild personality disorder and I suffer from what I think is depression and anxiety. I'm not just depressed, though, just this morning I got inadequately angry for spilling water. I lift up from depression occasionally to feel other lovely emotions like anxiety, fear and already mentioned anger. Anyway, I have troubled relationship with my family, mother particularly, and I've been always overly attached to my partners and picked them so they would appreciate such a trait (high level of attachement) rather than get discouraged by it. My current partner is my greatest motivation to get better, but I don't observe much progress even after a year and half of therapy. Biggest problem is that he's been a witness to several self harming sessions of mine, because I'm probably seeking either for attention or help or both. I've read that most people who self harm cut themselves on arms and sometimes other places, but when I lose my mind I start frantically scratching myself, pulling hair, biting any flesh that comes near my head or hit-cutting with a knife and I have the urge to stab a knife through my heart. Has anyone experienced this? Also it happened once in a presence of my parents (very recently) and those are the last people I wanted to know about this. I have episodes of elaborated cutting or pinching to relieve the tension as well, but when I really get lost I honestly have no idea what is the purpose of those scary fits other than seeking for help or attention.

To start, last year, my mom and cat died the same month. My cat actually died the week of my mother’s funeral. I was very, very close with her. She was he entire reason I went to college for a degree. My cat was there for me since I was a little kid, losing her was like losing a piece of myself... before I had a brain injury. She was all that was left to tie me to normality. Sure you could argue nobody is normal, but that isn’t easy to hear when you’re bullied relentlessly for being weird. I actually had to leave high school it got so bad.
To top all this shit off, I got denied disability for the second time, so now I have to wait another two years just to fucking hear no again. I submitted two fucking banker boxes of my medical problems, two!
I also need to deal with voc rehab since they helped me but I can’t fucking work with my disability, I’ve shadowed two different jobs and failed horribly. I barely finished college despite my longest day being 6 hours, with two of that being a break period. I feel useless and hopeless. I’m 25, poor, and draining my bf of his money. I just want to sleep and not wake up. Or have cybernetics let me have a cyborg body so my muscles and nerves aren’t as weak and painful as an 80 year old. 
I’m not going to do anything, mostly because I don’t even have the energy to attempt. But I’m also stuck in hell of struggling to sleep despite being exhausted all the time. I wish I was normal, I wish I wasn’t a fucking leach on society. I want to help so fucking bad but every doctor I’ve seen (5) has said I can’t work. Anxiety on phone, can’t do simple math, have a seizure disorder (so lots of places won’t want to hire me for that risk, they just have to claim something else to not be sued) can’t drive, and can’t lift more than 40 lbs. I also have pathetically low stamina, like the walk to my mail box wears me out. Yet the judge thinks I can fucking work.
...who knows, maybe I just have a victim complex. I know I’ve tried, but it still feels like I didn’t try hard enough, that I’m a failure, useless. This is with me on two different anti depressants that for the most part work, I’m sure without them... well... idk. It wouldn’t be good.

I began taking Lexapro in 2018 because I had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. It took a long time for the medication to work, but unfortunately it caused me terrible stomach problems. My anxiety has been terrible since I was a kid. I needed to figure it out. So late last November I switched to Prozac.
Worst idea of my life.
I started dating this wonderful girl who was independent and sweet and empathetic with me, which helped me sometimes feel like I could fight my mental health problems, but when the medication started ramping up in December, I started throwing and breaking things, and eventually we got into physical altercations. 
I have NEVER in my life been in a fight with another human being. I'm a small guy, I don't like confrontation, and I don't appreciate when people are irrationally violent.
Well, Prozac made me absolutely *violent.* It is still coming out of my system and I can feel it lessening everyday, but I still can't seem to hold down the  rage. I can't stop myself from having knee-jerk reactions to even little things like what I hear or what people say to me.
I am in so much pain because this medication isn't helping me control *anything* like my doctor promised. I'm going to start therapy in hopes to curb this, but I haven't had these issues since I was ten or eleven years old. 
Back in September I was happy, but anxious, and sometimes fell into depression, but I got out of it. I don't want to try anymore medication. I was perfectly fine just taking the hits and dealing with it on my own, but Prozac made me feel like I had no control. I still sometimes feel like I don't.
Props to my girlfriend (27F), for she hasn't left me while I struggle with this, but I'm feeling like an outcast too. I've slept on the couch for two weeks as punishment from her. I tell her how I feel and she says ""I wonder why"" and then tells me to prove I can be different. I just want this bullshit to stop! I'm so done feeling like this.

4348,dev_pid_4349,"Prozac and my new life : I've never posted anything on here before, but I stumbled on this subreddit and wow what a relief. To see the out pouring of people sharing their stories is amazing. I've recently started on medication (Prozac 20mg) and let me tell you WHAT A GAME CHANGER. My thoughts are far more clear and the so much negativity is gone. My ability to think rationally now is so unreal it's almost euphoric. It's been about a month now and I've gone through so many changes with my mental health it is truly exciting and such a relief. However, as the days go by and the euphoria of this clarity dwindles I find myself becoming stressed over the flood of thoughts and positivity. I was wondering if there was anyone else out there that can offer some of their experiences or advice to keep powering forward and conquering this what I see as a second chance with mental health. 
 To give you some background on myself; I am know 30 and was diagnosed with depression at a very young age (6-7). Until recently I wasn't aware of that fact which was honestly a bit disturbing to hear. Also, on top of that, as it turns out, I was medicated shortly after being diagnosed and for some reason given the choice a few months later to stop the medication (idk what med). Naturally as a 7 or 8y.o I chose not to take it anymore. For as long as I can remember I was always that kid that had some sort of erratic behavior. Anything I did it was to the max. Every feeling and emotion was amplified and caused me to act out in a less than constructive manner. I had and lost countless friends because of my behavior and never really knew why. As I got older the confusion and heart ache of not understanding why I was the way I was turned a lot of the embarrassment into fear and anger. Once middle school came around I started to act out and get in a lot of trouble. By 7th grade I had been arrested for the first time and severed every friendship I had but one. I then went to a private school for HS where things started to get better and I was able to reinvent myself. I was in a tougher area with tougher people who could handle me and put me in my place when things got bad. The trouble continued. I was arrested again sophomore year and the outbursts only got worse from there. I now realize that I was a person who self harmed. I tried on several occasions to hang myself in elementary school, I would make dangerous and impossible jumps to send me and my bike off knowing I wouldn't lad safely in middle school, I ran/skated head first as hard as I could into people on the ice and on the football field sometimes knocking myself out because I like the way i punished myself, I enlisted as a grunt in the Marines to go to combat and hopefully be killed so I didn't have to do it myself, I failed in college, I failed in a construction setting, I became a firefighter for many of the same reasons as the Marines, I torture myself with horrific online videos, and worst of all I was self depricating to the point of immobility and almost suicide several times. Last year I decided to seek help because I was in a relationship with a person I thought was the one. Best decision I ever made. After refusing so many times out of skepticism I finally decided to take medication. It took two different meds to find the right one but wow what a change. I can happily say I've made significant improvement in my mental health and finally feel I can be happy. I'm out of a toxic relationship and into a brand new world. Does anyone share similar stories or want to hear more about mine to see if you relate? Open to any and all questions.",severe

4352,dev_pid_4353,"Never Been Suicidal Until Now : I’m a 19 year old kid trying to finish up my second semester in college.  Up until I was about 17 I’d say I had a pretty normal life.  However, in January 2018 my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  He had a long-fought battle but the disease eventually took his life in January 2019.  In the months leading up to Jan. 2019, I missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse him on a day to day basis.  It was during this time when I believe my depression first was onset.  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep at most everyday while I had to watch my father wither away.  Consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my GPA dropped significantly and I was in a dual credit course at the time with the college I planned to attend which lowered my college GPA before I was even in it.  After my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof.  This left a rift in my family and I hardly hear from that entire side at all now.  Fast forward to graduation and Summer of 2019, I started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things.  This became an extremely toxic habit and I spent most of the money I had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia.  Finally, August rolls around and I begin my first semester at college.  For a brief period, things seemingly got better and I didn’t feel as empty as before.  However, about a month in I got a sinus infection and this persisted until February until I ultimately had to have surgery.  Around early December, I began talking to a beautiful girl who I really liked and once again I had hope that maybe things would get better.  It was at this time though I started abusing drugs and I would take Molly, Xanax, Coke, Percs, etc. to dull the pain I felt.  Fast forward again to January and rush for fraternities is starting to happen.  At my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being Greek so it’s almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends.  However, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections.  The house that I’m well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class.  Inevitably, I had to go to houses where I had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely.  I put a great deal of value into getting into a house because I had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things didn’t work out and I was left empty handed.  Additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then I have had very little contact with them.  On top of that the girl I was talking to got into an amazing house which I’m happy of her for, but this meant that I could only see her a couple days a week at most.  The week after rush I got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever.  My mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital.  The doctor told me I needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that I also had active mononucleosis.  As a result, I missed about 3 weeks of school in February and fell behind in almost all of my classes.  When I finally got back, I had to drop 2 of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i’m in at risk.  At this time, the girl I was talking to began distancing herself from me even more.  Fast forward to today, and I slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there’s good chance I need to unenroll this semester now and the girl I was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media.  I’m sorry if this is trivial, but I feel like no matter how hard I try life is just repeatedly beating me down.  So here I am today.

I dropped out of University because of my depression. I truly thought that I would never, EVER overcome my mental illness even a bit.
Now it's 2020. I recently saw my therapist for the last time, though I've only met up with him about 3 times in the last 2 years anyway. I haven't self-harmed in about 1.5 years. Last time I took meds was about 2 years ago. 
Do I still feel down sometimes? Fuck yes. I dislike my job and still struggle with self-hatred sometimes. I still don't have friends. But on average, I feel happy. I go to the gym 3 times a week, I have hobbies, I can laugh and I can cry (used to be too numb for that), I read a lot and work on improving myself, and most of all - I genuinely want to live. I want to know what else life has in store for me. I enjoy being alive. 
If you've read this then I just want to thank you for your time and want you to know that there is hope for you even if you are just like I was - absolutely hopeless and thinking that there's no way to ever be cured from this.",severe

4362,dev_pid_4363,"Wellbutrin and Paroxetine (severely depressed and exhausted) : Hey everyone,
I would really love to hear some first hand experiences, because I am in a terrible place right now.
I have suffered from depression for decades. I am currently taking 40mg Paroxetine for depression(about 4 years) and 10mg (3x) of dextroamphetamine(about 2 years, not everyday).
 If I don't take  the dextroamphetamine I suffer from severe lethargy, hollowness, lack of interest in almost all of the activities I am passionate about, horrible absence of sex drive and just a general ambivalent disposition about everything. The Paroxetine has helped tremendously with my obsessive thoughts, my insomnia and some aspects of my general anxiety; however, I cannot continue living life with this feeling of complete lack of passion and drive.
I don't want to be on dexedrine any longer as it's effects are dwindling and so I am thinking about trying Wellbutrin. I'm hoping that it will, to some extent, help with the lethargy and help negate some of the numbed feelings of Paroxetine. 
I understand that it is a DNRI, and I believe I understand it's pharmacological action. I know it won't give me the alertness that dextroamphetamine does, and that's fine. I just want to have my feelings of excitement, sexual intrigue, and interest in more than sleeping and staying inside the house. 
I know everyone is different, but please, has anyone went from amphetamines to wellbutrin and how was your experience? Any help would be greatly appreciated, I feel like I'm completely stuck.  Thanks!",severe

I called NHS 111. They deemed it not an emergency since I didn’t go through with it. I’m ok with that since I really don’t wanna spend a night in the hospital waiting room so I can chat to a psychiatrist for 10 minutes. The call taker was very mechanical about things. She told me to speak to a crisis team.
I called my local mental health crisis team. They said I should speak to the Adult Mental Health Team helpline (the one I called first). They said I should take my meds for the night and then listen to some music. Just mindfully listen and clear my head.
It was weird. They all just decided the call was over. They never asked if I had anything I wanted to say. Maybe that’s unreasonable for me to expect.

4368,dev_pid_4369,"Paralyzed from emotions : Its Saturday. Its a beautiful day out. There are things that I can think of to do and go.
I feel completely overwhelmed and paralyzed from my emotions. The past 2 hours I was laying in bed with my eyes closed trying to pass out or to stop thinking. I am constantly thinking of killing myself. I'm constantly thinking of what validates me to be alive.  I think purpose is self prescribed; but every day since I was young I keep hold on this existential shame and want to kill myself. I stop explainging that I'm upset to people other than just saying that I'm depressed. I wish that I didnt exist. I have been having disassociative feelings where I'm outside of my physical body watching a movie play in from my experiences for the past couple years. Things always feel like they get worse and more hopeless. 
I started doing things that I feel like are somewhat close to self mutilation but I feel too ashamed to describe to anyone. I started therapy a year ago because I keep thinking of killing myself and I begin to plan out how I need to do it to make sure it gets done instead of trying to find what good there may be in life.
I'm 33 years old. I see younger teens on here and some other ages too.  I have a lot of good things in life but they don't really 'mean' anything to me.  I have a job and enough money to live in a small apartment.  I don't feel like I have friends that I can really talk to and I get further from my family all of the time.
I'm just waiting to die everyday.  I wake up and fall asleep thinking that I shouldn't be alive.  When people describe to me what makes life worthwhile to them it doesn't make sense to me. 
I just want everything to fade to black. No more experiences.  I want to return to nothing - that's where I belong.  I feel like I'm crying but no tears come out.  Just this sinking inside of me and a soft shudder within my chest like quiet sobbing. 
I'm also bummed because my therapist (an intern who has been pretty good at describing emotional intelligence and helping me understand how to describe some things better) is going to possibly stop meeting me and she said she might refer me to a different therapist.

4369,dev_pid_4370,"Had a nightmare about suicide : I haven’t had a major depressive episode in three years. When I was depressed, I had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and I’ll never forget them. Lately, I’ve been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday I had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up.
In the dream, it was a sunny day and I was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great time. There was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and I went to go hang out with them; but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious (in real life she’s not depressed or remotely mentally ill at all so I don’t know why I conjured this up). She was saying stuff like “well when I jump off a bridge this won’t matter” and everyone was laughing, but I burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and I couldn’t stand the thought of her suffering. To make matters worse, I was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. One of the other people in the group looked at me while I was crying and asked, “what’s wrong?” and I said “because none of these people around me will be here after I end my life.”
Then I started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people’s parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could’ve done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. I said to myself “I hate thinking about suicide” and cried even harder, and then I “woke up” in the dream (but not actually in real life). Then after I woke up from that dream into another dream, I was suddenly in my best friend’s house traumatized from that dream I had. I was going to see my girlfriend soon, but I was still depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though I have her. Then I actually woke up into real life and was completely shaken by what my subconscious had generated.
I wanted to tell my friends about the dream I had but thought it was too morbid to tell them, so I thought maybe typing it out could help me get over it.",severe
4370,dev_pid_4371,"Desperately need help but can never seem to get results : I’m at a complete loss and have no idea where to look. My whole life people have perceived me as the funny, goofy extrovert. To be fair it’s a role I’ve given to myself, growing up I would always try to dismiss anything I found negative with a joke. Being the funny one allowed me to hide from reality and kept me happy. This worked fine throughout elementary school and made me a pretty happy kid, yet in middle school things started taking a turn for the worse. 
For as I can remember I’ve struggled with ADHD and anger issues. After middle school and throughout high school I started developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and borderline bipolarism. Im not sure if I can say I was bullied, but I have definitely been traumatized by certain friend groups and people. For example, in grades 8 and 9 I was in a toxic friend group with the older “cool kids”. Because I was the young one I was always seen as lesser and treated like I was everyone’s verbal punching bag. I would often be excluded from events or embarrassed in class because of the teasing. In grade 11 I once got confronted by an angry mob of big dudes because some guy that I beat up (in complete self defence) told someone that I was making fun of his autistic friend. This resulted in me getting circled and nearly lynched (not literally, at least I hope) for something I didn’t do. I still struggle with severe PTSD from that day. 
I’m not fucked up all of the time, sometimes I’ll go weeks feeling like I’m on cloud 9. But no matter what it all comes back eventually. The only thing I’ve actually had diagnosed is ADHD, simply because I have no idea how to explain my other internal struggles nor do I want to. Very rarely will I tell someone that I need help. Anytime I’ve ever tried to bring them up friends or family my problems were trivialized and met with responses like “oh things will get better with time” or “just wait till you’re an adult, you’ll figure it out”. 
Well I’m an adult now, and I sure as fuck haven’t figured it out. I struggle with the same issues I’ve had since I was a kid, and it’s made me feel so terribly isolated no matter how many friends/family I’m surrounded by. I’ve resorted to smoking weed every single day until I pass out to try and keep my problems at bay while I try to finish university. This has made me a lazy cunt that struggles to maintain what used to be my favourite hobby, bodybuilding. I’ve tried quitting a few times, however whenever I stay sober for long enough the dark stuff that’s haunted me my entire life just comes back. 
I’ve had to quit drinking, I can’t party with my friends anymore because every time I get drunk I let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. I’ve gotten into many drunk fights, and it’s gotten to the point where I will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. While drunk, it’s either the version of me that loves everyone and will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it’s the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. This is why I ended up loving weed so much, when I’m baked I’m the nice version of myself that I recognize from when I was kid. Fuck I wish I could go back to my childhood.
I don’t blame people for not understanding, I can never communicate it properly. Every time I’ve met with my psychiatrist it’s like I’m describing a completely different issue, I often times over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it’s like I just panic and lie whenever someone try’s to get me to open up. Because of this inconsistency lots of people just assume I’m full of shit all the time and I’ve definitely lost credibility on certain subjects. I’m only 19 years old, and I’m starting to reach my breaking point. I don’t know what is causing all of this, but there is nothing I want more than to feel consistently normal. 
If you were to see me in public, you wouldn’t guess any of this. You would see a nice, funny extrovert that has a wonderful family, good friends and gets good grades. Behind that mask is a lonely cunt that doesn’t fully understand other people and sure as fuck doesn’t understand himself. I do have lots of great friends and I couldn’t have asked for a better family, however despite my blessings I feel terribly cursed.

4372,dev_pid_4373,"Why do you choose to live? : I am super done with life. I hate living. I hate looking in front of the mirror everyday and looking at my reflection. I delusionally quit computer science when I realized even if I make 150k a year it wouldn't be enough to support my family let alone the people in my neighborhood. I don't know, I guess over time you start to sympathize with the kid who has crackhead parents and realize, there is an unlikely chance he is going down an educated path. Just by observing those people with same scenario my age. I look at homeless people and wonder the same thing. They are put on pills that keep them on streets because pharmacies is just a business. In my city the people prescribing them just need money and a job. The thing I hate most about myself too is the fact I feel sorry for myself, there are kids in the middle East who get drugged from a young age and used for militaristic purposes. There is the camps in China where people are getting raped, kids who are being kidnapped and used for organ harvesting and kept alive. People say the world is getting better but it feels blind. I know people in Canada like to seek themselves as good, but is buying a phone not technically supporting those evil acts. The truth is those phones are being made by underpaid workers in a different country.  There's also so many other issues. Like a lot of people hate on hip hop music and the hypersexuality and hypercriminalty aspect of it, but there's so many more layers to that. These artist who need to comply to middle class market since middle class kids bring in revenue from buying tickets to shows. They get all the blame for that type of music but the reality is they make it for the industry. If middle class kids liked bubbly music I'm a 100% certain these poor artist would start making music like that. The truth is in poor areas the reality is if you choose to go to school, you won't be able to support your familly so the two paths that do make enough money is selling drugs, or making music and blowing up. The other sad truth is 1 in some big number artist make it. Look at all those artist, most of the poor ones were criminals or lived a gangster lifestyle (in this generation). A lot of these artist don't want to do that. NBA youngboy (jail, drugs, etc), the Kelly (killed best friend), Kodak black (drugs, jail, etc).  
Why don't they just do pop? No resources, not enough time to work a 8 hour job, sing, create, etc. A lot of pop artist have big teams. If your a female in a poor area you're even more screwed. Most famous female artist in the industry went to music schools, were rich, and had connections. Their isn't much opportunity for them that can support their love ones. We see those who succeeded but not many of those who didn't. A lot of them did put work in too. My whole point is humans are corrupt and some people get the back end of it while others get built up from those people. The pharmacies, the organ harvesters, etc. Even everyday people are, we just been dehumanized to it, or are just blind to their actions. Anyways I ask myself, why should you live if you're just at the bottom? Hope? We see all these inspirational stories but the reality is most people don't end up like that. You have to pick a poison. In the world we live in it's getting harder and harder for people to make it out. Kids getting drugged at young age, underpaid workers with no education and no one willing to hand that out. Homeless people, being put into a loop, and from what I've seen, a lot of ignorant people judging them. Why should I live, work 5 times harder, sacrifice all of my free time, just to end up having the same job as the other guy? Also, I mentioned I hate myself even more for being ungrateful cause some people have less, but why? Why should that be okay? Why is that something you can tell someone. Be grateful, someone out there has it way worse. I disagree with telling someone that. There should be a fine line. I think kids shouldn't get drugged from a young age and turned into tools. Why is suicide looked down upon is what I'm asking. Hell, should I tell that homeless person to have hope? Statistically speaking, things aren't getting better for him. Enjoy the little things. This is where I am just being a brat, but it's hard to enjoy those things when I don't know if I'm getting food tommorow, and then I see someone on social media skiing down a mountain with no cares in the world. Humans are competitive by nature and being at the bottom you don't have many sense of achievement especially in the era we live in. It kinda gets to you. What is the point of living? Friends and family I never see cause we all have our own schedules and are super busy busting our asses off? Also people do care they just to social media to help. Reality is that doesn't help. We had a protest in my city recently and the way protesting in this era works is you make a post on your page. You can't get violent or cause disruption or else you get arrested. Therefore you just watch them as they do the thing you don't want. It seems like half the time people bring awareness to stuff it's cause it's trendy too. I saw so many post on the Australian fires, but a few on the Uighur camps in China. I saw millions mourn the death of a rapper, but minimal awareness to other things that are way worse cause it isn't trendy. Respect to black live matters but but what happens if you do that with another race? It doesn't work. Some races are getting fucked over way harder in this day and age. No one puts their hand up cause it's not a trendy movement, not to say the movements they support aren't important. 8.4 mill on black lives and less than 100000 combined on Mexican and brown. Sorry random rants in random order. Lots to get off my chest. What's the point of living. I'm a brown guy from a poor neighbourhood so just being a famous artist would be way harder just cause of my colour. I looked it up, and found only 1 brown person in a list of upcoming artist and actors list. The rest were predominantly white or black. Statistically speaking, woman are less interested in brown guys. Even brown chicks guys from other races. I'd say a lack of media portrayal has a doing in that. The other options aren't so friendly either. Go to school and not support my family. Bust my ass off, start a business and make enough money but at that point my chances are the same in music. What's the point in living? Hell I make it seem like I'm just saying for people at the bottom, but even other people too.",severe
4373,dev_pid_4374,"Depressed me ruined my life : Recently stopped a  depression med with my psychiatrist's permission. My symptoms immediately improved. Had been on antidepressants since 14; I'm 26 now. I initially did great after quitting the med, but taking stock of life has been a bummer.
I hate the (admittedly lucrative) field I'll be working in, but that doesn't bother me so much. I hate being an adult and not having the social skills to make new friends or have romantic relationships. I hate the vicious cycle of social isolation and social anxiety. I hate knowing that I missed out on years of essential social development. 
There are two things that really bother me about this. 
First, it's my fault. Men have tried to be friends with me (even recently), women have shown interest in me (not so much anymore lmao), but I just ignored them and wasted my life reading nonfiction books that serve no use beyond bringing a conversation to a halt as fast as possible. Why? First because of depression. Then because I had  isolated myself enough to have social anxiety. Now because I never learned how to have healthy friendships, much less flirt with women. All avoidable. 
Second, it feels like it's over. I didn't have experiences that can only happen at certain times in your life. I've passed the point where being socially incompetent is acceptable. It's fucked and I can't unfuck it. My future coworkers are largely in serious relationships or married. I feel like a child talking to them. They have preexisting friend groups, often near work. I have neither, and I already have a reputation for being weird and antisocial. 
Of course my life isn't ""over"" for certain, but there's probably a substantial chance I end up isolated and depressed again, and the fix won't be as easy as dropping a medication. Then it wouldn't be a cognitive distortion that my life is miserable, and the only way to escape my depression is to escape my life, it would be true.

4374,dev_pid_4375,"I need advice... : So I’m just gonna tell you my story.
I’ve felt extremely depressed for the past year and a half or so, ever since my dad died to a heart condition in October of 2018. Flash forward to now, and I’m still like I am, but I feel it’s worse. For one, my family is in very bad shape in terms of finances, especially due to the fact that my mother and father had a baby before he died. So it’s becoming difficult to pay for anything we need, like food, clothes, etc.. 
On the family side of things, most of us are just divided. Fights have broken out, causing some of us to just not show up to family gatherings anymore. It doesn’t really help that I wasn’t exactly close to any of them in the first place. I just feel like I’m caught in the middle of it all. And I feel hopeless because I have absolutely no clue how to help, nor do I think I can.
On the personal side, I just have this deep, severe hatred for myself now. Not only does feeling like this leave me tired and I just have no drive to do anything anymore, even the things I normally enjoy, but it gets really bad sometimes because I sometimes think that I wanna kill myself, and that the world would be better off without me. That the pain would finally end. On top of all that, I’m CONSTANTLY bullied, online and in real life, for enjoying the things that I do, or I just get bullied in general. I also struggle to make friends, because I feel extremely insecure. Most of the kids at my school are super popular, and I’m just this socially anxious, insecure kid in the corner. People tell me to have confidence and people will like me, but it doesn’t work. When I try to be confident and tell jokes and stuff, it leads to people calling me weird, laughing insultingly, or just being silent. Even the friends I do have do this sometimes. My best friend in the whole world (he has always had my back and never once insults me or anything, he just constantly tries to help me out) moved away and I never get to see him anymore.
I’m super sorry for the long explanation, I just really wanna feel better, but I keep losing hope by the minute. I feel like there is zero chance for me to get better. The only chance I have, in my eyes, is for this to all get progressively worse.

4378,dev_pid_4379,"The world is cruel, unfair, and unforgiving : I have fought this fucking disease since I was a child, apparently born with it, as m symptoms started cropping up during elementary school. I also was diagnosed PTSD, Autism, ADHD, anxiety, and paranoia disorders. I have just reached twenty and yet feel like my life is over.
I have no parents, no family, NO ONE. One of them died when I was in elementary school. My parent tried to shoot themselves in the face in front of me, neglected me, and threw fits of rage early in my childhood. The other abandoned me at birth but I was never put into the ""system"" and tossed from place to place, grew up in a rural hellhole that is rife with crime and poverty, no home. 
All I have left is one of my grandparents, as I watched the other one die, and I weep constantly at the thought of my grandmother dying too. Because I know it is inevitable. Life is cruel.
Nature is not fair. Humans as a species have overcame so many barriers as a species to evolve, yet we create these meaningless societal institutions constructs that create even more unnecessary struggle. All my life I was told my goal was to be good in school, to be smart, to land a good job, and I would make it.
I had no idea that I would be raped as a teenager. I had no idea that I would be molested by doctors and that would create a lifetime of PTSD. I had no idea my first two partners would abuse me. I have tried my damndest to stay in school whilst these terrible things happen, but there is no forgiveness for weakness in this world. 
I remember not finishing some student council powerpoint in my last month of high school. I didn't go to school my last month, as I was borderline suicidal. I remember a teacher getting up in my face and telling me how I didn't deserve to be a leader, how disappointed people should be in me. She had marked me down for months despite me scoring a perfect on the AP exam, because she preferred my sister in a foster home above me, and knew I was terrified of her.
 Another teacher was great friends with the guy who molested me and gave me straight 0s for missing school because my PTSD had become unbearable. The principal told me I should give up my ""dream universities"" and settle for a local tech school that didnt have my program. It was not fair. They didn't realize what I went through at home, or my lack of one.
It's been 3 years, and the people I graduated with are in junior year of university, I am so behind. I managed to go to a somewhat good private school later on with scholarship, but I hate it here. I was borderline molested by another doctor who pushed me around and touched me innapropriately, my PTSD is so bad to the point where I can't breathe if I hear anything medical related.
 My school's organization is a mess and many people fail. I keep having to withdraw from classes cause my disability accomodations were denied. People are rude and catty. I sit in my room and have severe paranoia and panic attacks till I sob and shake with pure agony. My psychiatrist doesn't believe how bad I am. It is unfair.
After being in 2 abusive relationships I met a guy online and things were going fine for a bit. We visited each other in different countries. Then when my PTSD got bad he started calling me a special snowflake, saying I was horrible, a drama queen, mentally unwell and ill, must have been exaggerating my abuse, etc. Ruined my self esteem. I am visiting and in bed with him right now and he is so sweet and kind, yet I remember his cruel words. I truly do not feel loved by anyone in this world.
I wanted to be a scientist to research cures for depression, but my school could care less for me. No one cares about me. I have no friends, no support, and my physical and mental health is shit. If there's one thing I've learned in doing scientific research, it is how cruel and vile nature is. I can't handle all the pain in this world.",severe
4379,dev_pid_4380,"There’s nothing good about my life : I’m 18 and I’ve been stuck in my room for 7 months. I don’t go off with friends near as much as I used to, mainly because I can’t 
About a year and a half ago I started selling drugs. I was really good at it, and I had a constant party life style. I had money to blow, drugs to run through, and there was always something to do. I got up to about 15k at once point 
We would rail coke, get drunk, smoke weed and all kinds of shit the party would never stop even when going to sell the drugs. I would have cars lined up outside of my house, really fucking stupidly, coming one after another. 
I got so used to this standard of living. Everyone wanted to be around me, I had people I didn’t even remember meeting saying what’s up like they knew me. I wasn’t famous or anything, but it was like I was around town. During this time I managed to get kicked out of high school my senior year 
All of my “friends”, I started to almost never hear from. It’s like I became a loser in a matter of weeks 
I don’t even know how I managed this, but I quit selling and blew through all of my money in months with not a damn thing to show for it. Almost all of my “friends”, I started doing kratom when I was near brome, a legal opiate basically. It made me okay with laying in bed doing nothing all day, and I felt way less bad about my life 
I realized I was just another guy, I’m not special at all. My goal with selling was to get enough money to start up something legit like a business, I refused to work a 9-5 and slave away all day. 
Well long story short now I’m broke. I stay in my room most of the time. I ended up getting my GED, but I haven’t done anything with it. No one really wants to hang around me anymore and I’m not invited to anything. I feel more alone than ever before 
I want to actually become something, I have plans. Plans that I haven’t acted on, everytime I bring myself to do something I just end up falling out on it. I have almost no motivation, but I’m also scared of being a failure. I don’t wanna be another guy working paycheck to paycheck struggling to get by. I know I can’t succeed if I don’t try, but it’s just scary having no idea what the future holds. These negative thoughts have kept me from even trying, like I’m useless and won’t be able to do anything if I tried. 
I’ve thought about killing myself a few times, but I don’t think I’ll ever act on it, I’m too afraid to die. There’s a lot more that goes into my depression, but that’s the gist of it I guess. I thought about deleting this just now, but whatever I think I sort of explained my situation",severe

I’m so angry and bitter and I can do nothing but cry most days I just don’t know what to do. I mean therapy is the best option but I don’t have money and I’m pretty sure my insurance can’t cover it or at least enough of it to help me out.

I always thought I just had ADHD and couldn't pay attention but I've noticed that the things I remember are only THINGS I'm interested in. I can't remember birthdays, promises, or even conversations from the day before clearly, but I can remember a 15 digit random key passcode with relative ease. I've told myself countless times I'll try to always acknowledge my partner's feelings and to think clearly about what I'm doing means for them, but every day it seems I convince myself again that only trying to do what I think they want isn't emotional manipulation.

This is going to be a long one, so buckle up. Usual story, normal childhood up until 8th grade when my mom became an alcoholic. Rough experience in high school, dad has to work to support us we have to fend for ourselves. First suicide attempt was 16. Things got a bit better, until around 19. Second suicide attempt after losing a job, a gf of two years and dropping out of school. Go to the psych, clinical depression. Have trouble keeping a job and getting back to school until 22. Meet an amazing girl, maintain a job for 9 months, make plans to go back to school, gain some muscle. All is well until this past summer. Job is causing so much anxiety, just don’t show up. Gf breaks up with me (totally justified) bc I cant bring myself to do anything. It’s been 6 months. Still not over her. Lost 25 pounds of muscle in 3 months. Don’t have a job. Struggling through these semesters. All of my “friends” are graduated college, never invite me out. Don’t blame them, I’m not sad on the outside but the one’s gf never liked me and that circle always talks behind everyone’s back. Only thing I enjoy now is playing guitar and writing music, the only positive thing in my life. So, I’m 23, my friends don’t like me, my ex is done with me, I’m not going to get a bachelors for at least another two years, I’m sickly, pale, scrawny, socially inept, jobless, living at home, and depressed. I think the beginning of change has to be today or I won’t make it. I decided to delete all social media apps (group chat so no talking to friends, same with snap, instagram, Twitter, and after this Reddit.) I’ve always been hopelessly optimistic but I think life has finally burnt me out. Not sure if there is a point here. I will try. But I’m just so far behind, I already met and failed with the love of my life, drive away all my friends, am a burden to my family and society, and have no skills or talents or worth. Don’t try to cheer me up please. Just listen, understand, acknowledge, and be on your way. I do my best on my own, I always thought. But the older you get, the less that rings true.

4383,dev_pid_4384,"I need to vent a little bit : Well, I was diagnosed with depression in December 2018, I was prescribed Lexapro, except I can't afford it, so I get Connect instead (which is a generic copy of Lexapro), for a year I've been really shitty, almost like I was able to deal with everything before because, well, *I wasn't depressed, I didn't have it so bad*, or at least that's what I told myself, until the diagnosis which really threw me to the floor...
There have been a couple of hotspots of hope here and there, some days I don not want to kill myself, some days I do, but I mostly just want to *cease* to exist, to be free you know?
One such hotspot of hope, and the reason I really want to vent today, was a girl I had been connecting with at uni, for about 6 months now, we've become very close friends, but as one is wont to do I developed feelings for that girl, she seemed to reciprocate my advances, letting me hug her and she hugging back, she sitting next to me in class, playing with my hair and sometimes bringing me food.
She invited me today to an event to an amusement park, where we paid around $20 for 6 hours of unlimited passes to any game we wanted to go, I was really looking forward to it, but lo and behold when I got there she was with her boyfriend whom I've never even heard of before.
Of course, I was crushed, I *am* crushed, I feel... empty, odd... I dunno... almost betrayed? But deep down I know I wasn't betrayed, we never dated or got serious (she said ""te quiero"" a lot to me, if you know Spanish you know it's a very wholesome ""I love you"" but it does not necessarily imply romantic love)
I don't know how I feel, just... down... I called it quits after three hours there, I just couldn't handle seeing them together, the jealousy just got the better of me.
And I feel very guilty for posting this here, I don't even know if this is a proper place to post this, but I just want to hear some advice, some help, right now I just want to get *DRUNK*, I am trying to talk to some buddies to get a drink, I want to be *numb*, I want to be *stupid* and enjoy bliss in ignorance, or at least to feign ignorance. I feel like shit, and I know this is gonna trigger a very bad episode of just plain old depression, the kind where you just want to stay in bed and do nothing, because nothing seems to be worth doing, I've been getting those a lot, the last thing I needed was this, but such is life huh? Sometimes it just guts you right there and then and you are just left *there*. *Alone.*
I don't want to be alone, I don't want to feel so worthless, I don't want to be the piece of shit that I feel I am. I want to be better, but I don't know *how!* I just don't know! And I've been trying, and trying and trying hard and nothing seems to work, and everything I do seems to be going to shit, I don't even know how the fuck did I get where I am at uni, I am four courses away from passing all the necessary courses for graduation and yet, I feel I do not belong where I am, I feel like I am a living lie, I feel so incredibly stupid whenever I take a test, I don't know how I keep getting passing grades. I know no one is willing to hire me, as I've been trying for about a year now to get a job, even trying to talk to my contacts to see if they can put in a word for me, but I never get an interview. You know, I feel like I am going nowhere, I feel like a terrible weight to my mother, and I feel a lot like my father, who is also an unemployed POS, I really dislike my father, and yet I feel like everyday I am becoming more like him, just an angry, envious, jealous (he always shouted at my mother accusing her of cheating), I feel like I can't control myself. I look at the mirror, and I don't see myself, I see him, and I just don't want to be him, I'd rather pick up trash in the street to at least hold a job, and somehow I feel that's insulting to the people whose job it is to pick up trash.
I take care of three little quails, their names are Leonarda, Yang and Marianelo, two females and a male respectively, and when I pick them up and I feel their warmth, it's almost the only thing that makes me not want to quit just yet, but in the end they are just silly birds, and I say silly in the most loving way possible, but they just like to run free and very rarely come to me.
I don't guys, I am losing it, some days are bad... some days are... some days are like today. I am losing control, I just want to let it off my chest, I just want to be heard and I can't find anywhere else to throw my voice, this is just a hail mary, I don't know what I am doing, I just want to feel better, I just want it all to end.

The best part of my life became the worst part of my life with the worst depression I have ever had when she just stopped talking to me all together out of the blue, and at the time we were in the same class every morning, so needless to say it was annihilating me from the inside out for about a month, until she all the sudden wanted me back. This happened 2 times until I just said fuck it the last time and blocked her on everything, graduated high school and havent talked to her since.

4385,dev_pid_4386,"Not sad or happy about my life but just nothing : I am 25, bilingual, gay(not ugly and above average looking and fit), Asian, nerdy(lived through most of my life being making fun or hated for my eccentricity)
I have no friends, but many acquaintances.(maybe I am putting friends to a very high standard)
I never had any relationship even though I came out 7 years ago to my parents, and being very open about my sexuality.
(I don’t want to share my body to strangers, so I reject all hook up attempts, and I feel that most gay people I met are just insecure, aimless and superficial) 
I am not shy, and I am eloquent and talkative in front of people. I can easily manage social scenes, but I don’t actually care how others think about me.
I was diagnosed with depression since high school for 4 years. I quit the medication few years ago because they are influencing my intelligence(seriously, I am going to work in software development, and I would rather feel shit but have a functioning brain than living in an illusion of relief and happiness caused by drug)
I born from a very conservative family in one of the East Asian countries. I hate my country and escape to US to study and hope to settle here. I have been here 7 years. Now I am getting a master degree in US, and I will be interning at one of the prestigious software company in this summer. (Now, I realize that my hatred to my mother nation is pointless, my suffering is purely due to my unfitness to this world, and nothing to do with policy and culture)
I struggled through the hardest part of my depression by following these tips below.
1.keep a routine and stick to it, no matter how tire how shit you feel. a to-do list such as “I will wash clothes today at xxxx” will help
2.abandon social network, they are toxic to your mental state. I only use it to share information rather than show-off my fake good life or see anyone’s fake good life.
3. Leave toxic people, and YES, most people are toxic to you especially if you are eccentric person. And give up on people, give up on hoping someone will magically show up and fix all your problems. 
4. A healthy life style is very important to keep you energy level up. Eat good, sleep good, be active.
5. Search on some higher purpose of life. I give up finding any happiness from human connection. I never felt love from a man before, never in a relationship, disappoint by people again again and again. Then I stick my interests to machine, I study computer science and I am fascinated by technology. I develop a religious zealous of what a future world I want to create or envisioned: i want to create something amazing, something redefining current human social structure. A world where outcast like me can feel happy and comfortable to live in. A world without crowd stupidity and adheres to the mercy of humanity, a world without division, bullying and misunderstanding.  That’s why my major focus of my computer science degree is artificial intelligence, go figure. The current state of humanity is pathetic, and that is why there are so many depression on this earth.
7.  Then, accept that it’s ok to never feel happy again. But the key to manage a life is not being always happy. I feel that I am more and more in the middle ground: not happy not sad, but just nothing. In these years since I was diagnosed with depression, I find out a single truth. 
Depression can never be gone and it can only be managed.
I gradually accept the fact that I am just a machine,(human body is in fact, just a machine)and I won’t feel the same happiness when I experience the same events like normal people do.  I will feel nothing, but sometime I feel that these kinds of nothingness is a form of tranquility. As long as I am not in constant pain and agony, I am fine with my current state. When people hurt me, I don’t care. When people benefits me, I don’t care. People are too predictable for me, and they are not important anymore. (The only exception is my parents because I feel sorry for them to suffer me)
However, after I live with these mindset for years, I gradually observe that not all people are asshole in nature. Not all people are ignorant. I will feel delighted to see when some people act differently from my calculation. (Someone who are supposed to hurt me, do not act upon, or someone who are supposed to benefits me, do not act upon)
Maybe as a person with depression, I can never experiences the joy of “living” with in this world.

4394,dev_pid_4395,"I Want To Die and Don't Want Help : I don't know what the point of this post is, random people can't really help with the issue. I've been depressed since around 12, started taking meds at 17 and stopped at 20. I'm about to turn 21.
In those 9 years I've wanted to die, to kill myself. I visualize it happening and ever since I was 13 it felt like it was destined to happen. I still think this way. I was closed off and alone my whole life, I have no social skills and can be pretty emotionally unstable if I don't put walls up and just be indifferent to everything. This helped me avoid too many suicidal ideations in high school, but when I went to college I resolved to talk to a therapist and psychiatrist, and be open and try to make my empty life less empty.
It failed, the meds did not help. I was being emotionally open and connected with people, made some friends and even a boyfriend and lost them all due to my intense mood swings and bouts of suicidal actions. I tried to kill myself twice in 2019 then dropped out of college because I missed so much class from hospitalizations. 
I shut off and I'm back to being empty and not interacting with people. I can't do it. I have no support network, I need to be alone and sad because it's more stable and less dangerous than the alternative. As I realized this and started taking classes online, I know I'll kill myself in ~5 years if I continue this way. I want to get some job, move away so my parents don't find the body, and work up the nerve to do things right this time.
Every few months I feel this want to die or to cease to exist become stronger and I'm doing nothing to fix it. Do I even want help? Do i think I can be helped? I don't know anymore. All I know is that trying to get better made things so much worse, I don't have a stable enough support network to try that again. Truthfully no one thinks about me and no one cares to talk with me, I've actively isolated myself and done a 10/10 job. 
Does it stop? Can it even stop if I don't do something different? I can't/won't do anything different so am I just going to keep daydreaming about dying as it becomes more and more of a reality?  I'm pathetic and a lost cause, and I wish every night that I just won't wake up. I deserve to be dead, the only thing I'm worthwhile as is worm food. As dumb and bad as it sounds, I either don't want help or think I deserve help/can be helped. 
So that's it. One day (hopefully soon) I'll pass without fanfare or a note and no one will even notice.",severe
4395,dev_pid_4396,"[question] How to deal with loneliness/emptiness inside? : Been depressed for 7-8 years now, I live with an amazing father that supports me no matter what but he only stays home for one day in the week cuz he is my only financial support, and almost every day I spend my day alone. I have friends, but only a few know about my depression, and sometimes I just feel like my rants are just annoying. I don’t really go out, because I don’t know where to go. I play games just to distract myself but that’s only temporary. I started dating, online dating, I thought maybe finding someone that I connect with, that I can meet up have a good time with and eventually have something beautiful like an actual relationship would be helpful to the loneliness/emptiness inside, but so far it’s not going well, people are just looking for something else in life I guess, can’t even have a conversation anymore lol. So I don’t know what to do anymore, more friends isn’t the thing that I want, I just lay in bed everyday listening to music, or just sit at my desk playing games to cope with the loneliness, but at the end of the day I just still feel it, I make music as a hobby but that’s more a stress relief.

They didn’t know anything that was wrong with me for sure until I was 18 when they discovered a rare partial chromosome deletion that kills 80% of the babies in the womb, And 80% of the survivors In childhood. So the 4% of us who live two adults typically also have a lot of mental and physical issues along with an extremely weak immune system. Thankfully somehow I ended up with a very high IQ and not needing be in a extremely special needs classroom. I actually worked for many years the extremely special-needs classroom and looking at the students that I could’ve very easily been one of them is very eye-opening and I think sympathy was help me a lot of being a teacher to them. Unfortunately last April I had to stop working because by issues got so bad as it was so sick I couldn’t a whole day at work. most days now a day I’m bedridden because of how sick I am and how much pain I’m in. 
Because my home is it issue is so rare the fact that I don’t even fit the textbook case for my chromosome deletion the doctors have no clue how to help me, besides just giving me lots of meds to help with the symptoms because they can’t help with the cause, because they don’t really know what the cause is. When you see multiple doctors a week and you constantly are told by doctors that they no longer want to see you as a Patient because There’s nothing they can do to help so there’s no reason to keep seeing them, They just tell you to see another doctor but they are the fifth or 10th or even more in the line of doctor saying should go see this doctor instead because I can’t help, Even though they were the last suggestion. In the last two years I’ve seen it least so good G.I. doctors and the last one just turned me down as a patient last. 
Some of the meds they have me on are multiple opioids, Muscle relaxers, pain killers, and more. Everyone keeps warning me that I’m going to be addicted but that’s not the case in fact I tried to take as few of them as I can and save them up In case something happens in the future I need them or I can’t get my meds right away which is happened do you stupid insurance. Some days thought I want to take the more, I want the pain both mentally and physically to be gone. But I’ve been good so far I’m not taking any extra.

I started taking it after struggling with depression for at least two years and OCD since at least elementary school. I didn't expect much but it made my life much more livable. My OCD symptoms vanished into thin air and I've became quite content with my life. 
But while being generally content, not all symptoms of my depression disappeared. I still regularly slept for at least 12 hours a day, became totally tired early on during the day, and still had little focus or motivation to do anything that would have advanced my life in a better directions. So after years of living my life as an involuntary slacker, I told my doctor about my symptoms and he gave me a prescription for Wellbutrin (150 mg a day). Again it worked quite well. While the focus took some time to finally return, the sleepiness vanished soon after starting it. I was quite happy that it worked so well, and at first I didn't get any harsh side effects that I've read about. I've only been slightly confused at the beginning, and had some kind of mental fog, dizziness and only some slight memory loss at times.
But after two to three weeks I started to get head, muscle and some really terrible joint aches. The headaches remained only for a few days, but the muscle and joint aches now have stayed the about the same for at least two weeks. I suspect that they got slightly better but I'm not totally sure. 
I'd like to continue the medication since it works so well with respect to my symptoms but I'm not sure whether the side effects will go away. I will of course talk to my psychiatrist about it at our next meeting.

I still hate my body no matter how many muscles I have, im eating healthy for that exact reason, going to school every day is the worst part because im sitting there and just one wrong thought is sending me down a spiral of self loathing and self hatred were I nearly begin to cry and cant follow the class at all.

4403,dev_pid_4404,"My experience with cold showers : Some background: I have a girlfriend whom I live together with, I study and have several job commitments. I think I might suffer from dysthymia, so I'm generally considered ""high-functioning"". 
So, during a long period caught in a depressive state I decided one day to take a cold shower, and it proved to be a slightly life altering experience. Before this I had times where I'd go 3 days without showering and starting the day way too late which resulted in me doing half-assed work and generally neglecting all the things I consider important.
I start by taking a hot shower, to properly wash my hair, face, armpits and junk. I then finish off by suddenly switching to ice cold water, while standing still, focusing on my breath. It's very uncomfortable to begin with, but I feel a surge of energy, alertness and warmth(!) thereafter. It feels VERY nice to step out of the shower afterwards.
Some days I hardly want to do it, but as long as I commit to getting in the shower, and then commit to changing the temperature, I am all set for an ""optimized"" morning.
It has now become a habit, and I can not do without. The feeling of getting out of a warm shower is just a bummer compared to getting out of a cold one.
If mornings are especially hard for you, I suggest you try out a cold shower. Don't make it too cold the first few times, and don't stay too long in the cold water. Focus on your breath and relax your muscles as you're showering. 
To the people who decides to give it a go, I wish for you a positive and uplifting experience. Please share your experiences! Was it pleasant or unpleasant? How did it feel after? Would you do it again?",severe
4404,dev_pid_4405,"Get immediately stressed over short messages : Upon re-reading this, I know this is probably more anxiety related than depression related. I apologise
Currently I really don't have too many friends. At all. I have no friends in real life that I talk to, outside of occasional classmates, and online I have one friend I speak to very very occasionally. She doesn't often like to talk to me too often, which is okay, she makes more of an effort than a lot of other people do. 
Despite knowing I don't really have any close-knit friends, I do try to reach out to people. Whether it be people I used to talk to frequently, or people who I want to try to get to know, I do actively try to talk to people and make new friends. 
But after the first message I just feel insane amounts of guilt and anxiety over it. I get pissed off with myself, internally bereating myself like ""Why the fuck are you sending them a message? You know they don't want to talk to you, if they did they would have said hello in the past 3 years"". 
Then usually when getting replies I feel even worse. They're pretty short ""heys"" or ""cool"" or one word answers I can just feel are the other person going ""literally what do you want from me?""
I feel so goddamn lonely. And I'm constantly in this battle between ""Look just don't talk to anybody at all and only speak when spoken to"" and ""Look you need to make an effort with people for them to like you"". 
And I try to make an effort, but I just can't strike properly with literally anybody. Not online, not even in real life. 
I wish I could stop wanting to have people care about me. I wish I could be okay with just not having anybody in my life. I feel like such a failure even without the fact I can't connect with a single person in my same species.

Not the worst, but heading there.
I cannot seem to cope these days, thoughts of ending it all are frequent, no matter how much I talk to my therapist (I do talk therapy and have medications), no matter how much I read self-help articles, I take my pills as prescribed, nothing is helping.  
My therapist says that not having enough money is a major trigger for me, which is true, since I grew up poor and am now struggling to make ends meet.
Does anyone have any advice on how to pick myself up when everything around me is broken or sellotaped together? Nothing works and I have no money to fix it...
I am not a materialistic person, I just think I've hit my limit at how much I can take...
For a bit more background: I (F, 32) live in a studio apartment that my grandmother left me, it is legally mine, so I don't pay rent, only property taxes twice a year. I am unemployed and looking for a job for about a year now, but nobody wants to hire me. I live off of what I make by baking cakes for people and babysitting for neighbours.

4409,dev_pid_4410,"Much happier girl now? : Hi guys, for the last couple years I was super depressed and it was hard finding people to talk to because they would not see it as a problem, either girls would tell me they wish they had that problem or guys would contribute to the problem for the most part. 
I don’t want come off as narcissist but people find me very attractive and my larger chest area doesn’t help. I realized since I was perhaps a freshman in high school. Senior guys inviting me to parties, male teachers giving me special privileges and occasionally their eyes would wander away from my face. I didn’t really see a huge problem until I got to college. I wanted to date, find a nice guy to treat me right and I found it was super hard. 
The majority of guys that I talked to weren’t looking for anything more than a hookup. Some guys respected the fact that I didn’t want a hookup but the majority of guys would go along and pretend to want more when in reality they didn’t. When I would ask to get to know each other more before we do anything, I’d be called a tease, accused of leading them on and told hurtful stuff like “I’m sure other guys have been in your pants, why can’t I get some” do you know how hurtful that is. And eventually, complements meant nothing to me, I’d get so many and they all felt sexual in nature. They were all based off my looks and nothing more. 
Guys with girlfriends were a lot of times the worst, if they saw me talking to their boyfriends, they’d get super jealous, if we’re studying for a test together, they assumed I’m trying to take their man. I would never try to get in between someone’s relationship and if your boyfriend decides to flirt with me, I’ll do my best to make him know I’m not interested but I’m not responsible for his actions so don’t get upset at me. And a lot of girls would just seem to be in competition with me and I’m not. Or some of them would make it seem as if they are worshiping me and it just felt weird. 
Then things got worst how people assumed things I get stuff based off my looks strictly. Like I’m not going to lie people have given me special treatment but I’ve never requested it and I’ve never depended on it, I’ve always been dedicated to working hard and earning what I want. I remember my sophomore year I was taking a Number Theory class which is harder than it sounds. I took a test, the mean score was about a 55% and I got a 91% and a girl claimed I got a high grade based of my looks. I studied hard for that, I tried to get a group together where she was invited and she declined. On my test, the problems were done correctly, and she claimed it was based of my looks. That was just so hurtful. 
As time went on it just bothered, and I became depressed off of it based off the idea that I did not think I could ever find love. I’m a start girl, pretty but I felt like I could not find a guy to talk to where the topic of sex or my boobs did not come up before a couple conversions. It just felt like that’s all guys saw me for. And I know looks fade as time go, I don’t want a guy who just has sex with me then goes and brags to his friends, or realizes that I won’t always be this pretty and move on to another girl eventually. And I could not talk to people. Girls would always say they wish they had that as a problem, and guys would always “listen” and the next week they’re asking for pictures of my breast. And my family didn’t make things better either always asking why I don’t have a boyfriend, it must be so easy for me. 
That just always bothered me and brought me down significantly, I was never in a great state of depression but it was something that was just there and it was hard to talk to someone. That was something that bothered me until last year. 
One day my car battery died at school and a friend and I were outside for about thirty minutes trying to jumpstart it. But she drove a weird Jeep and you had to unscrew stuff to get to the battery so we were there for a while. Eventually this guy came but and asked if we needed help, he has a portable battery in his car. I assumed he was just another guy trying to get into my pants. But that was not the case. He came over and actually helped, he knew what he was doing. We talked a bit afterwards, found out we used to live in the same area. He’s a volunteer firefighter in the town over now and he’s an economics major with a math minor. Then he said he had to go, he didn’t get my name or ask for my Snapchat like most guys do. 
There was just something about him, the way he was super kind to do this gesture for me without expecting nothing in return. I was somewhat attracted to him. Luckily, I started seeing him on campus all the time and we would wave to each other. Eventually I got brave enough to go and talk to him and I did. We became friends and started talking a lot, he was super kind, funny and a weird sense of charisma. And I started realizing just how handsome he was along with his super muscular bodies. One thing led to another and we have been dating since then. This man treat me right, makes me so happy, makes me feel cared for and for much more than my body. Every conversation is not just about sex, he actually listen to me. Asks about my dreams and aspirations and I feel so comfortable around him. Every once in a while I do catch his eye wandering away but with him, I do enjoy it and sometimes his eyes would stay there a bit longer after I catch him haha. His complements mean much more to me, because they feel genuine and much more than something to get into my pants. I love this guy a lot, and I generally don’t advocate for getting into relationships to fix depression. But I’m this specific case it helped me, I’m so happy with him and I could see us lasting and I would like it to and he feels the same.

She likes a boy, they reject her, then she comes back to school really depressed, saying things like “I wanna die” and when she IS in a good mood, she makes suicidal jokes that aren’t funny because we don’t know whether she’s serious or not. Whenever she makes a joke like that or talks about her problems, everyone’s happy mood disappears. I don’t think it’s bad to vent, but I just think there’s a right time for everything. When we’re talking about funny stories together, you don’t all of a sudden say, “Haha yeah, I wanna die.” Instead of telling EVERYONE, tell one person you think will help the most, “Hey, can we talk privately?” Because not everyone knows how to deal with your problem and will instead make them feel like it’s their fault you’re not feeling better. I don’t wanna tell ANYONE who is depressed this because I have a feeling it’ll just make them feel worse.
I’ve been trying to help her, telling her to take a break from dating, but I feel like my words never reach her and it just makes me feel bad that she hasn’t progressed. Yes, I will carry the burden with her and help, but when I see that carrying the burden and helping her isn’t making her feel any better, I get depressed as well.

4413,dev_pid_4414,"I don't know how to cope anymore : I've been diagnosed with chronic depression at the age of 10. I am 21 now and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder too a few years back.
In the past it wasn't so difficult to go through the day because I had school and was busy all the time. Apart from my social anxiety and awkwardness I still had friends and a semi normal life. My strict parents did prevent me from doing things with my friends. So I ended up losing most of them when I got out of school.
I ended up dating a guy (my first official bf) for almost 2 years, we broke up last year. It left me in pieces and I'm still not over it. I can't connect to anyone emotionally anymore (guys). Also, my best friend got into a friend's with benefits relationship and kept choosing him above me even though I was there every time he hurt her. She chased me away when I wanted to spend time with her so she can be with him. So I decided, because of this continuous toxic behaviour I am not going to put in any effort to be her friend anymore.
I overthink a lot. I get angry easily. I cut people off very easily. And I know it's my own fault that I'm losing people around me. I know I'm a shitty person. I hate myself. I don't know how to cope anymore people around me because I feel like eventually they see what a bad person I am and just leave me. I have just always felt like I don't deserve to have people in my life that care. That supports me. I've always done everything on my own. The only people that I do believe support me are my parents, my brother and some other family members.
I have tried to commit suicide multiple times. I think about it on a daily basis. I can't see myself having a normal future so what's the point of living. How do you live with yourself if you're toxic on the inside and all you do is self criticize, self hate, dislike people and see everything negatively.
I get up in the morning and I'm fine but somehow I just keep losing myself more and more each day.
I try making myself happy by being financially independent to a degree, having a job, having my own pet, starting my studies soon. But at the end of the day all the bad things end up bothering me so much and I make everything seem so much worse than it probably is. 
And I have seen therapists but I simply can't afford it and it doesn't seem to help anymore because my depression keeps changing and evolving.

How do I support him and not take it personally? : To preface, we’ve been together 5 years. We have a dog and a house and a life. We’re not married, but we’ve both expressed growing old together and living out our lives together.
My depression is just kind of like a backpack I pick up and wear every day. Sometimes it’s heavy, but other days it’s just there holding my shit. My partner, on the other hand, was under the impression that he was the worlds most capable, happy, fulfilled dude, but has recently discovered that he is in the bout of a debilitating depression.
His friendships are fragmented, his family is dealing with some heavy shit, his job is taking a severe toll on him and I’ll admit that my depression backpack has been very fucking heavy lately. Honestly, the man has a right to be exhausted. Especially since he’s so unfamiliar with the “boundaries” word.
Yesterday (or two days ago? I haven’t slept or eaten in days as a result.) he told me that he needed physical space to work this out on his own. My higher, more reasonable and logical self understands this. I am currently on a plane back from a 10-day solo vacation I took for the exact same reason. My fragile, insecure, depressed ego, on the other hand, is terrified. I’m finding another place to stay, but he can’t tell me when he’ll feel ok with me “coming home” again. 
He is devastated. He sobbed on the phone with me for hours telling me he was sorry, that he doesn’t want to hurt me, he doesn’t know why he’s just learning these things, he doesn’t know why he’s like this, etc.
For a couple of weeks, the “I love yous” have been few and far between. Why? 6 weeks ago it was, “You’re my queen. You’re my person. We’re the best team. I love you I love you I love you I love you.”
I am spiraling. Higher self says “this is just a vacation” and fragile self says “he doesn’t love you anymore and he’ll just keep retreating from you.”
I want to support him. I am in this to win it. How can I support him and support myself at the same time? How can I implement boundaries during this time that make us both feel secure? How can I stop seeing this as a sign that my relationship is over? Does he not love me anymore?

Even if they say they do, they never show it in action. I posted another cry for help on Reddit before (with another account) but moderators deleted it for no reason before someone even replies. I've tried therapy, psychiatrists didn't help. In fact, opening up to people actually made it worse. I just want people to consider my mental condition and treat me better instead of giving me advice. But at least after therapy I know that I have Autism, Psychotic Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, OCD, Maladaptive Daydreaming Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. I think I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. I know what is happening when one of my other personalities is controlling me, but I have no control over what thay say or what they do. One of my psychiatrists said I'm just ""too schizophrenic"". I can't communicate with people. I can't have long lasting friendships. I have never felt loved and I don't even know what it means or feels like. I don't feel empathy or sympathy.
I gave myself time to think about this. I realized something: I don't want to just end the pain, I don't want to live. I'm tired of waking up and trying to survive the day just to do the same repetitive things that I do everyday. I don't want a job, I don't want money, I don't want to graduate. I seriously don't want anything from life. But that's not the worst part. I live in Iran. In Iran when guys turn 18 they have to go to military academy for 2 years (or you can keep graduating and then go to military academy after you're done, but it's a rule and you can't escape from it). I can't even imagine 2 years without my PC. After all it's one of the things that kept me alive. I wish I could live in another country, but that needs a lot of money and I have to take IELTS test and go to military academy anyway. Otherwise I'm stuck here. Hold on a second... If I live in another country I need a job, so it would be pointless.
The other thing that kept (or maybe keeps) me alive is my daydreaming. Real life is very boring and repetitive. If I could live in my daydreaming forever, it would be nice. Something like a different world which I could live in. People in my daydreams are all fictional characters and I like them more than real life people. That's why I can't just quit it and go find real friends. They actually helped me a bit with their emotional support.
There is no other way. Nothing will change if I stay alive, and I can't change anything myself. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I want it, the story of my life doesn't have a good ending. I wanted to give myself 1 more year, but that's just pointless. I will kill myself on my birthday.

And that's not a good thing. Depression breaks through sometimes, but it's really rare.
I don't really know why, but it's almost like I miss feeling sad. I miss never being happy. I miss being able to think about me dying, and it's weirdly hard to do that now I'm on medication. And the fact that I miss that just terrifies me. I mean, I always knew that I was a really horrible person, but was I seriously faking being depressed all this time just so I could feel special, or so I didn't have to take responsibility for my laziness and just other shitty qualities? Sometimes when I'm feeling good (for my standards) about myself I think that I am actually depressed and that me thinking I'm not is just a symptom of depression but I have my doubts about that. I don't know, I'm just so confused right now.
And then on places like this subreddit, I read about people who are really suffering and I feel like shit for not exhibiting the exact same symptoms that they do. I know there is a massive amount of different types of depression and nobody will have the same experiences, but it's almost like I use every single scrap of evidence to try to prove to myself that I've been faking it and I'm a terrible person and all of that crap.

4430,dev_pid_4431,"Antidepressant not working? : Hey I am a 25 year old man who has struggled with anxiety and depression for all my life. It would take too long to tell you about all the issues I've faced but in summary I suffer from OCD, BDD, GAD and physical pain (most notably severe nerve pain in my left arm) which has caused me to become anxious and depressed.
In December 2019 I finally realized that this was not gonna go away by itself and all the therapy talks and CBT was not helping. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed Lexapro which I was on for 5 weeks (first 2 weeks I was on 5 mg/day, and then 10 mg/day). I didn't really develop a good rapport with this psychiatrist so I changed to another one who I really like. On lexapro I felt that my mood was elevated and even my anxiety/depression started to improve a little but the effect was kinda shortlived and because of sexual side effects (took forever to ejaculate) and fatigue, my psychiatrist recommended me to switch to another medication called Trintellix (Vortioxetine).
I quit lexapro cold turkey and started Trintellix 10mg/day instead. Once again I felt my mood elevate and anxiety/depression improve but after 2 weeks I was back to baseline and a week after that I increased my dose to 15 mg/day and the same thing happened again - 2 good weeks then back to baseline. I've been on Trintellix 15 mg/day for three weeks now and I mentally feel pretty bad honestly. I don't have sexual side effects which is great, although I suffer from erection pain due to a botched circumcision (hopefully will do some foreskin restoration to get more skin and decrease pain in the future - need surgery first to remove scarring). I still am tired and have issues with concentration which isn't great since I am in medical school (although I am on medical leave now - but I was thinking long term it would be a problem.) What is bothering me most though at the moment is the pain I suffer in my arm which was caused by a bothed blood draw (basically the nurse hit a nerve in my arm and more than three years later I am still in pain - I know I'm not the luckiest guy alive haha...). Due to my OCD and general frustration I actually aggravated that injury by constantly pushing and aggressively stretching out my arm - stopped with that now but yeah I made the situation worse.
The Trintellix has helped with anxiety but everyday I am in pain and it's weighing heavily on my mind besides hurting a lot. I would say it's the biggest contributing factor to my depression and it makes me devoid of energy and I have no will to do anything - the only relief I get is when I am in my bed or sleeping. I've tried to keep up the hope that it will go away but after three years it's unlikely. My psychiatrist said I needed to accept my injury and the pain but how do I do that? I read online about treatments for nerve pain and the antidepressant amitriptyline came up often but it seems to have so many side effects... and as strange as it sounds I don't like the idea of medicating against the pain - I want it to go away by itself.
In summary I am in a bad place not really knowing what the next step should be. I was planning on going up to 20 mg/day which is max dose for Trintellix and perhaps combining that medication with a stimulant like Modafinil which doesn't seem to interact with Trintellix, which adderall, ritalin, vyvanse etc... seem to do, in order to combat my fatigue and concentration issues. What do you think of this plan? I feel the big issue is the nerve pain but I don't know if you can even treat that? Any other tips for me?

I always say I'll improve, but I don't. It's not that I'm not an intelligent person, in fact, It's been proven that I have a pretty high IQ, so my parents are always telling me that I should be doing better and that I'm 100% capable of it blah bleh blah. I tend to forget to turn things in a lot of the time, and I don't always get things done in class. I've tried hard to block out a traumatic experience that occurred just about 1 1/2 years ago, (I was targeted by a sexual predator) and I think I've forgotten more, but I still remember, but I don't think about it. I'm really sorry. I'm not sure how to explain it. I don't know what point I'm trying to make. (My anxiety, however, has gone down a great amount now that I am surrounded by friends, so I'm happy about that.)  I hate talking to my  psychiatrist and my therapist, I kind of want help, but I really don't (If that makes sense) I don't want to be sent somewhere again, I don't want to be put on more/ higher doses of medication, I don't want to be constantly under the microscope, I don't want somebody telling me why I feel the way I do when that's really not the reason why, I just don't want people to be constantly bugging me. I want to be comforted? by someone? that's not one of my parents, or any adult, I want to be close to someone, but I also don't? It's a feeling that I don't know how to describe.

In the beginning of 2018 my grandmother committed suicide and my whole family took it hard, especially my father. He spiraled as soon as it happened and almost went down the same path. I shut off — couldn’t read (which I love), couldn’t study, couldn’t work, and it was senior year. 
Thankfully I did get into college but I’m a year in and it has been terrible. Still can’t study, failed a bunch of classes and hate my major. I have been getting worse and worse, so about 6 months ago I started therapy (I know, should have started as soon as it happened). It has been nice but the progress is very slow. I don’t feel like myself anymore and everything I used to love doing doesn’t feel nice anymore. 
The one thing I can still keep up with and that makes me happy is interacting with my horse. He is pretty much the love of my life and everything I do is about him (including what I decided to major on). However, he got sick for the 100th time (he is very sensitive) and the vets are saying he will have to retire and might lose quality of life. This was last week and it completely broke me. To top it off, my mother has always been my rock, but lately our relationship is terrible and I have never felt more alone. 
I don’t feel comfortable reaching out to friends, I barely leave the house and I’m feeling utterly useless and broken. I have exactly 0 hope that things will get better and my mood ranges from wanting to kill everyone to crying in a corner.

This person meant the world to me. Their family did too. I was able to work through my depression by talking to, spending time with, and feeling a part of something. I’ve also been in love with this person for a long time. However, in my selfless ways, I never let that be a complication. Until recent I found out they were terribly unhappy in their marriage for many different reasons. I was here for her to speak her mind, offered her sound advice as her friend kept the love I felt seperste. I Respected her vulnerability and never compromised that. She then was so overwhelmed with everything and dropped the biggest blow on me that I’ve ever felt.
She’s been having an affair for a year and a half with some other guy. This crushed me and everything I ever knew. As a friend I was mad. As a lover I’m heart broken. I feel horrible for her kids, for her husband. Now, I feel sick. I feel broken. But this isn’t about me I kept telling myself. But then she said that this guy listened to her, was just like her, understood her, so on so forth. And then I ask, “what was I to you through this time?” That was the hardest thing to hear her say. 
Then she asked me, “ do you love me?” At this point I knew things will never be the same and I said, “yes”. She said “why didn’t you tell me... I felt the same way for a long time...” I said because you’re married with kids and I never knew you were unhappy, besides I’m not that guy to home-wreck. I would never do that. I’m better than that. I wanted to wait until she was settled and on her own two feet. But I’d be there to help at all costs. And she knew that. 
Now I’m left with nothing. I don’t have my friend. I won’t ever have the love that I felt, be real. I’ve lost the relationship with a family that I care about. It will never be the same again... I can’t shake this feeling of complete loneliness. I feel sick. I have no appetite. I can’t feel anything. This level of depression is something I haven’t felt in a long time.

4443,dev_pid_4444,"I lost a friend to suicide : Hey, friends. 
I wanted to share this in hopes that it helps just one person or puts things into perspective. 
Two weeks ago I found out my friend passed away. He took his own life. I worked with him for about a year and a half, he would go out for drinks with us every once in awhile, and him and I would go out by ourselves once a month or so. We weren’t super close, but we were good friends. When he quit, we stopped seeing each other as much. 
Three weeks before he died, I called him up and asked for a huge favor. He lived within a mile of me and I needed his help changing a flat tire and wanted him to show me how. He had plans that night but said they could wait and he’d be over within an hour. When he arrived, I asked how he was doing and he made a sarcastic comment about how everything sucks. I asked if everything was okay and he said “not really, but that’s life!” He helped me change the tire, I gave him a hug and told him we should get drinks soon. Him and I had leaned on each other in the past when we were struggling so I wanted to be there for him. 
I didn’t reach out soon enough. When I heard the news I was in shock. I was with a friend and went into their bathroom and literally fell to my knees and silently sobbed. When I drove home that night I cried. I took a different way home than normal and by coincidence passed the bar that him and I would go to. I had to pull over because I was crying so hard. I was sobbing and screaming “it would’ve been okay, I promise you. Everything would’ve been okay.” As if he could hear me. The next day, I had to leave work because I couldn’t stop crying. I took the day after that off. I couldn’t think about anything besides the fact that he was gone. Whenever I was outside I would think that everything just felt different. The world feels different and empty without him in it. 
You always think about how sad your parents will be, your best friends, your SO. He wasn’t my best friend, we saw each other once every 4 or 5 months. Even ex-coworkers who hadn’t seen him in a year are grieving massively. My coworkers and I arranged a dinner with his family and friends last weekend and I witnessed first hand the grief they were experiencing. 10 of us who worked with him showed up, one drove 5 hours to be there. The others opted out because they were still struggling so much (they will be attending the official memorial). My point is, death reaches so much further than you think it will. 
I’ve been there, and I know that when you’re feeling so low, you truly think the people in your life will be better off without you. I’ve also gotten past that and have made amazing progress in my mental health journey. I also recognize that everyone has different struggles and I’m not trying to downplay anything you might be going through. But experiencing the grief, and seeing the grief that the people closest to him were going through adds even more perspective to it for me. 
Anyways, this was way longer than I expected. Reach out to your friends and tell them you love them and are there for them, if you’re in a place mentally where you are able to do so. And feel free to reach out to me personally if you are struggling.",severe

My dad doesn't accept me for who I am, and who I've been since I was conceived, and cannot come to terms with the fact that the only ""little girl"" he had was a bag of bones and flesh, and doesn't value me as his child or as a person. 
My brother is ambitious, and seems to be at that stage where he's starting puberty and is either insanely hyper or insanely tired; fucking grumpy or happy as a rabbit. He's terrifyingly ambitious and wants to do absolutely everything right this second, acting like he's got a bomb strapped to his chest and his time is almost up.

He doesn't know that I'm dealing with depression that makes me want to sleep all day, makes me become easily bored with every want and need, makes me want to be left the fuck alone, and makes my head feels like it's caving in on itself because of the lack of ""happy chemicals"" in it.
He doesn't know that I'm dealing with ""Trans-Guilt,"" that makes me almost unable to look my parents in the eyes anymore because of what my brain tells me I've done, because I've ""killed"" their daughter-- my dad's only daughter-- and that I'm a disappointment because I didn't amount to what they'd planned for me in my life, and how that makes me want to stay away because I'm sick of my presence being used to fill a room, and how I always seem to hurt people. 
He doesn't know that I'm dealing with ADHD, that's scrambled my brain like a fucking plate of eggs, and given me at least 1 or 2 F's in every fucking quarter of this year. 
He doesn't know I'm dealing with Dysphoria that eats me alive every morning, noon, and night, and makes me want to peel open my skin like a fucking banana, and has me on my knees, praying to every God there supposedly is, to please stop. Has me wondering if any God is really up there, and if so why I'm like this, making me wonder if I was Hitler in my past life, and what I did to deserve this crawling skin that will never go to sleep at night.

Weak as we are, we accept and search for other solutions. We turn to them for help. They do not want to. They 'help' by murdering those sick in the streets. They 'help' by dragging people out of their homes at gunpoint. They 'help' by arresting people for being sick. They 'help' by giving us a phone number. A FUCKING PHONE NUMBER.

4462,dev_pid_4463,"Life is Messy : (This is a throwaway, as I know some friends know my main account)
I've been diagnosed with depression for almost all my life. Or maybe the anxiety came first. It's hard to tell. I only have a few memories that came before my diagnoses. Everything else is just a blur, as it is for most people.
I was- and still am- always on medication. It would work, at first. I would have some semblance of normality. I would be similar to the others my age. But after a year or two, it would fall apart. The pills would have less and less of an effect. I would switch to a new medicine. The cycle repeated.
Anxiety and depression are almost like Ying and Yang for me. Anxiety makes me over-react. Depression makes me under-react. Having both going at once feels like a virus. It's a program constantly running in the back of my head, sapping processing power and slowing me down. I know it's there. I know what it does. But I don't have the tools to remove it- only lessen the effects.
Sometimes I feel guilty. I have a lot to be grateful for. I live in a safe place, with shelter, food, water, rights, and liberties. I have friends, few as they are, and family. I can do what I want to do, buy what I want to buy, go where I want to go. I can be who I want to be. It just doesn't feel like it.
It's like something went wrong in my code. Like a single, important code was forgotten, and is unable to be fixed. Only the emergency systems run- the rest are in constant shutdown.
I understand the science behind it. Certain chemicals in the brain can be too high or too low. Taking medication can fix that- for a while. What I don't understand is why I can't overcome these issues, when I have full acknowledgement and understanding of what went wrong.
If you have a broken leg, you need to give it time to heal. You keep it wrapped, so it has a chance to heal correctly. Then, you slowly work your way to a normal state.
But what is normal, for someone with depression, or anxiety, or any range of mental illness? What is normal, at its basis? If I have never had the chance to experience life without these problems, how can I work towards the basis of normality?
I feel like something is missing. I'm trying to find a piece to the puzzle, and no matter how hard I search or study or tear through my belongings, I can't find what it is. Some part of me needs to be replaced or switched. I have no idea what.
My mother recently told me that she attempted suicide when she was younger. I can't remember the exacts of it, only that she didn't get caught and it didn't work. Else, I wouldn't be here.
But therein lies a problem that I can't overcome. She knew that she had depression. She got her diagnosis, just as I did, so many years ago. She knew very well that it could be passed down, as it had in other family members. Yet she still chose to give birth to me.
All my life, I've asked many questions beginning with the simple ""why"". Why am I like this? Why won't anything work? Why can't I change?
But now, I truly have to ask: Why did she give birth to me?
She knew the possibility it would pass down. She knew it could cripple someone, mentally. She knew the effects- she experienced them, herself. She still went through with having me.
I love my mother. She's given me more than I could ever imagine. But I can't forgive her for doing this to me. And I don't think anything will change my mind.
Nothing will change my mind, just like nothing will ever change for the better.",severe

4465,dev_pid_4466,"I got caught hanging myself : Two days ago I took a hangman’s knot to my school in order to kill myself. Throughout the day people asked about it and I said that I was doing a photography project in order to spread awareness on depression and suicide. Anyway, the classes finally ended and I went into a bathroom stall in order to hand myself. The stall had a window that led to a pathway with a lot of people. A guard saw me and notified IW (Integral Wellness, an emotional support group from my school) 
I eventually gave up on the idea of dying through hanging because it was too painful and managed to reach a wall and untie the knot. I walked to the exit and a guy from IW touched my shoulder and asked if we could go talk somewhere else. I knew what was up, so I decided to play along and go talk where he wanted to. He said that someone saw me hanging myself and notified them so they could have a chat with me. 
I cannot express how enraged and irritated I felt when they started talking about it. I don’t know how to explain it, it’s as if I had just been caught doing something I was not supposed to do. 
They told me that they would have to notify my parents and come pick me up. 
My mom took more that 2 hours to get there and all I heard was “Why would you do this to me?!” “You made us feel upset!”. It seems that they are playing the victims now, what the fuck am I supposed to do now. There was a snitch in the family and now everyone I know knows about what I did.

4466,dev_pid_4467,"Hesitant to accept I’m depressed again. : I struggled with depression a significantly age 15-18, the product of witnessing a murder at 16 and being assaulted at 17, I ended up even having to retake a school year. I tried a few medications, Prozac launched me into psychosis and hospitalised me and Remeron made me angry and otherwise dead behind the eyes.
I had therapy that entire time and eventually with the help of two excellent therapists, worked my life out. I finished school, got a place at university and moved to the city I always dreamed of living in. I met a boy and fell in love and gained some real confidence.
But the city I moved to wasn’t everything I hoped it would be and my relationship isn’t either and my confidence is godawful and practically nonexistent now despite the loving words my boyfriend uses. And I’ve slowly sunk into a depression again despite doing what I could to fight it (I even went on a surf trip to africa, trying to reset my confidence and my self worth and remind myself how beautiful and exciting life can be blah blah - but I was significantly depressed there too). And now I sit here, with a life that from the outside seems pretty fine, but internally I hate myself and want to die.
I’ve found myself thinking about suicide as a sort of back up plan again which is something I used to do.

No one knows though, as far as everyone irl knows, I'm fine. 
I just want someone to know that I'm not fine, im the opposite, And ive come to terms with it. 
About a year ago when this originally happened, I let this out with thoughts in my head. Now I typically let it out with reddit posts. 
This all started with the thought, 'i wonder how people would react if i were gone.' 
Then the first person I told about it was my girlfriend when this happened. This is my biggest fuck up. I got myself so attached to her and then when she broke up with me, I could not handle it. She did it because i was too stressful. I was letting out all of my emotions at her. 
But she couldn't take it, and i ruined everything.
Its not her fault. I screwed up the relationship. After an entire year i still can't get over this. I hate myself for it.

I've been on a handful of medications since I was thirteen. I'm twenty now. I don't remember whether I took my previous medications consistently or not, but I recall either Zoloft or Prozac making me numb and having to stop the medications. Wellburtrin, the previous medication before the one I'm on currently worked for me, but only for a week and a half. It was great while it lasted, but I ultimately figured it was because it took me a long time to take Wellburtrin consistently, and now that I had, my body had gotten used to it. I've been taking my current medicaton, Lexapro consistently and noticed that I was beginning to feel happier. Then, again, just like Wellburtrin, I noticed my depression beginning to seep through, having moments where I will get depressed, then happy and excited for life, then having a huge mental breakdown and realizing my medication was no longer working for me. 
Lexapro worked for me for.. I want to say a good week and a half, and I've only been on it for two months at this point. I understand if medication stops working after a long time, but the past two medications I've taken and that have worked stopped after a week and a half of happiness. I feel hopeless and like any medication I take won't work for me, and like there's no point in even continuing to try. Is this normal?

4476,dev_pid_4477,"Some psychiatrists are really... weird : Warning: This post deals with social issues and can be potentially triggering.
This happened a few months ago in October, when I had to be hospitalised for suicidal ideation (it was voluntary and only for a couple of days).
The first thing I had to do was talk to the psychiatrist/doctor and explain my situation. I went over the obvious reasons for my depression; being isolated, being left out, no self-esteem. Then he asks me about friends. I explain I have a couple people I consider friends but I rarely talk to them, let alone hang out with them. He wonders why that is. I say I don't like to open up to people and am afraid of being hurt. Then he asks if I have a girlfriend (I'm 19) and I say no. He asks if I've had one in the past, I say no again. *Then*, and this is the weird part, he asks me *why*.
I'm pretty much stunned at this point. Why does that seem odd to him? Am I really that much of a fuck-up? Is it not normal to not have had a girlfriend at the age of 19? I take a moment to process this and just blurt out ""I don't really know?"" He goes on, asking if I'm not interested in relationships. Of course I'm fucking interested. Does he not realise that the other person has to be interested too? Can he really not see that I am not someone people are interested in? I can't just go up to a girl and say ""Hey, you're my girlfriend now. Love you."" Apparently he thinks it's weird that I've never had a girlfriend. Well thanks, don't I feel good about myself. He literally said: ""That's odd."" All I can think to answer is ""Okay?""
Then he tells me I should hang out with people more. That I should go on walks with girl friends. Well, I'd love to, but you see, other people don't want to do that. And who am I supposed to befriend? I don't go to school and am unemployed. I don't have any contact outside my immediate family. I can't just message someone I barely know and start talking. That's honestly creepy.

4478,dev_pid_4479,"Coming up on my one year anniversary : I was committed a year ago because I had a detailed plan. Have had major depressive disorder all my life, but it got progressively worse after I was dragged back to work (in a job I hated) two weeks after major surgery, and 8 weeks before my surgeon wanted me to. That's a pain and a weakness I wouldn't wish on anyone. I was in a wheelchair for two weeks so I could still do my job, but I'd feel my muscles tremble from sitting upright after only 30 minutes.
Husband (who can be the world's biggest jerk, and I refuse to defend him in this instance) declared ""I wish you'd just kill yourself when you say you want to"" during an argument that only he wanted to have (he didn't think I should have lunch so he'd have more time to play cards, where his parents were going to feed him. He really sounds like a major abuser, and he was and can still be). I kicked him out that day, and was going to go to work, then come home and take a hot bath. I figured it was the largest chunk of time before I'd be missed.
Luckily, I had a counselor who knew something was horrifically wrong. After prodding, I spilled it all. She helped me get admitted to the hospital and stayed with me until a family member could come take me. I was scared sick, because my mom always stigmatized being committed because it would ""end your teaching career forever."" Can't have that, can we.
While I was in the hospital, it all stopped, and it was insane for me. I knew I hated teaching, and I hated my job. I hated it all so much. I hated that I was constantly called to put my job and my husband's bank account ahead of my own sense of fulfillment. Visiting hours were great, by the way. My mom and sister knew what my husband had said to me, and no one was their usual warm selves to him. In therapy sessions, I talked out what would happen if I abandoned my teaching career. It occurred to me that I still have the people skills, the problem solving, connections, etc, etc. When my certification expires... I don't have to renew it. The idea of a traditional classroom filled me with so much dread...
I told my family, and the same day I was released, I went to my boss (who I loved, it was my big boss that demanded I return to work. She's loved by no one). I didn't bother with changing anything about my clothes, except to put on certain clothing items they confiscated. And I informed her I'd be quitting at the end of the school year. Period. 
Two months into my unemployment, while we were in Japan (long story, don't ask) I was thinking about what my therapist had once asked me: ""What would you do you if you knew you couldn't fail?"" Well, I had wanted to be a veterinarian when I was a kid up until I was 17...and then my depression told me it would never happen. I was that weird kid who mapped out my entire life, and before the internet had a wealth of information on that. I talked to vets, I read every SINGLE book I could find, it was my thing. I was that kid that people would bring their animals to look at, and I could tell them a rough diagnosis, and what kinds of tests they would need to do at the clinic, so they'd be mentally prepared for the bill. Vet school was out, but I had researched veterinary tech programs while I was a teacher: the problem was that they were all full-time programs during the day. But hey, that was no longer a problem! I burst into tears when I realized that I HAD figured out why I needed to stay: I had shlumped into my teaching career because my depression told me I had to. I applied for the only accredited school in my city while we were docked in Tokyo Bay. (Husband, who didn't know me back when I was Weird Animal Girl, thought this was impulsive and out of nowhere. It wasn't until the next morning, when we called my mom, that he realized it wasn't impulse. Mom said ""oh, thank God, that's what I've been waiting to hear for years."" She told my grandpa and his response was ""It's about damn time!!"" He had to realized that oh, no. This was a huge part of my personality he hadn't noticed)
I started classes three weeks later. Every day, I am JAZZED to get to go to class, and even more excited to do the one thing I've always wanted. For the first time since I went into teaching, way back in 2009, I feel hope. I still struggle with depression, obviously, especially because I've lapsed on therapy (fricking copays)...but I maybe found the thing that will keep me going.

We worked slower and I thought I had everything under control, but turns out I didnt and error report was written by the next shift. That means I have a meeting on wednesday where me and some bosses will go trough why it happened and how it can be avoided in the future.

I wont lose my job.
This has happened many times before, I have even written two such error reports myself about the very same thing. 
I miiiight get a warning. I dont think so.
My boss called me a “major resource for the department” on our previous personell meeting.
What I also know:
There may be stern words that we should have worked slower to catch up(which we did)
People will look very serious
It will all feel like its my fault, like I am hopeless.
I will feel my face go red and tears start running
I may or may not succeed at my usual method of pretending I get coffee down the wrong pipe and cough, excuse myself and cry in the bathroom. But when I do, the redness wont go away for like 45 minutes.

Yes I have family but they don’t understand. I can’t open up to them. All I get is either annoying optimism or meaningless platitudes. How can I ease the burden on my mind when the gut wrenching depression is all I know? I feel lost and adrift in this bleak ocean and I don’t know how much longer I can keep my head above water.
I’m 30, I have nothing to show for it but a life of regrets. The only things to bring legitimate joy was my kids, and now that they are gone, what left is there for me? I can’t handle losing that connection I had with them, and I feel it slipping.
I just can’t shake the feeling that things will never get better. I’m drowning and there’s nothing around for me to hold on to. It scares me and leads to mental anguish, which feeds back into the self hate and suicidal thoughts. Which scares me and and repeats the process.
It’s easy to say no when you have things worth living for, it’s harder when those things are so far away you’re effectively alone.",severe
4485,dev_pid_4486,"I keep daydreaming and having fantasies to pass the time : I didn't realised at first. I think this is a long process with ups and downs. I'm 28 and I think I've been depressed since I'm 10. I've been having fantasies to escape reality. I don't do it on purpose, I can't help it. It's just that it's better than real life, it's ""less boring"". I daydream while I was on high school, or when I was on uni or now at work. Even when I'm by myself at home reading things on the internet, or if I visit family or hang out with friends, things will often get boring and I will escape reality. I imagine how my life would be if I was able to get tons of chics, or if I was rich, or if I had some kind of superpower of ability, or if I lived in a fantastic world, or if could time-travel at will (to correct my mistakes, or to experience several timelines, or to simply get rich by betting like Marty McFly). I'm realising that the fantasies are getting more detailed and sophisticated. My latest one is that I imagine myself having some kind of little calendar book or pocket diary. For observers the book will look ordinary, and they won't see anything weird, but for me, I will see text and pictures appearing on its pages. The book will tell me anything I need to know: ""Don't book that flight, it will crash"", or ""Call sick that day, because it's gonna be a bad day at work"", or ""Don't forget about that thing"", or ""Next time you have a debate about this topic, you can refute them with this argument"", or ""These are the football matches results for next week, and this is how much people are going to bet"". Also for satisfying my curiosity ""What was the population in 100 AD? (like the exact one, not estimates)"", or ""What is the Voynich manuscript about and what does it say?"", or ""Did Jesus really existed, and where and when?"", etc, etc. This will help my anxiety because it would prevent me from taking risks, it'd make  rich of course and it'd satisfy my curiosity. I'll be reading in my book calmly and others would think I'm just checking my calendar.
Anyway, this kind of supernatural things will never happen. I know that. But I keep fantasising anyway,
One of my hopes is that with the progress in virtual reality, I could experience these things to some extent some day. Sometimes I'm optimistic when I see all the progress in technology and how the economy grows (we produce more, salaries are higher, etc). But when I see how shitty politics and society is, I get pessimistic.

4486,dev_pid_4487,"Why can’t I commit suicide? : I can’t do things anymore; I’ve been living with it for 9 years of constant suicidal ideation and 13 failed attempts as of tonight.
I had the pills in my hand, took half of them and ended up throwing them back up before I could get the rest down. I hate living and it’s too painful to keep trying and falling back worse.
I’ve been through intensive therapy, been admitted and sectioned before; none of it has helped, nothing releases my pain or anger; I just end up making it worse.
But my body is physically rejecting my attempts against my will; if I cut myself, my arm jerks and I end up with minor cuts; it I take pills I those them up.

4487,dev_pid_4488,"What to do these days? : I've struggled with Depression and anxiety for all my life now and every time I'd feel alone or down there was always something I could do.  Usually when I'd want to feel better I'd go to a cafe and read or just chill to calm down or go look for cool things in stores . I could even go to the swimming pool or gym.  Now that's all taken away from me.  The only thing left for me to do is go shopping at grocery stores and all that adds is stress these days.  My dog recently died and now I can't enjoy a single thing and my anxiety seems like it's going to make my head explode.  Even my camping plans for most of summer are gone because I can't camp with a tent I need a camper.
So I guess what I'm asking is, has anyone found new ways to cope with their negative feelings?  I need to find a way to bring myself back from this episode I'm having.",severe

Never in my life have I ever struggled with suicidal thoughts or feelings until now. I'm afraid to tell people how I feel, I don't want to stress out my family, friends, and girlfriend. I feel alone and the one person I want to talk to ignores me and that makes my feelings amplified. I feel like I have nothing and that my life is just a waste. I've been told by people I rely on others too much for my happiness. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel so alone",severe
4490,dev_pid_4491,"Really need to vent : Posting thins is therapeutic and I need to get this out right now before I explode any further.
I am absolutely disappointed with myself and I don't understand why the fuck I even exist. I am average at best in everything i try to strive for. Life wasn't always good for my family but I never felt like I hit this level before. Since college, I've slowly hit a depressing spiral that has only accelerated and gotten worse over time. Before I even started my first semester, I lost my dad, which just shook my whole world beyond belief and ever since I feel like I just can't win at anything. I'm even fully aware of some accomplishments that I probably should be proud of but I can't even acknowledge them, they just feel undeserved. I'm undeserving. I get so overly attached to people emotionally that when they inevitably leave I can't recover. I constantly deal with this brain fog and loss of motivation to the point that I feel inadequate in every aspect of my life and find no joy from passions. I just have to phone in the emotions I believe I'm supposed to have during any moment. I've fought through suicidal thoughts and then some. Now I'm to the point where any minor inconvenience tips my scales easily and if it gets too bad I cut my arms with scissors. 
Y'all I'm so tired. I don't want to kill myself, I admit suicide scares me so much. But I also don't want to do this anymore.  All the painful memories, the mistakes, all of it is too much. I keep trying to push through but I just don't want to anymore. My old self is just gone and what emerged is someone no one should bother wasting time or energy on in any shape or form.",severe
4491,dev_pid_4492,"Aren’t we all just tired? : I’ve been depressed for months. 
I lost trust with people irl. 
I now lost trust with people online — whom I had established relationships. 
I don’t know who I am anymore. I act differently than what I thought I should be?
I used to be sociable where I put on a mask of fake smile because it’s socially acceptable. It’s what people expect from me. 
I thought it was never ‘me’ as despite the mask, I’m sad, miserable, depressed and bulimic from the inside. 
I got hit by a bad depression relapse last August and things went sour. I stopped wearing the friendly mask irl and hid myself online. I became distant with people. I only talk with 3-4 persons irl out of tens to hundreds of people that I know in person. And this is in the premise that these 3-4 persons sent me tens of messages and gave me several missed calls before I respond back after days. 
I am very distant that I only have a poker face on from the outside. 
I do started wearing that happy mask online. On reddit. But it never gave me my sense of self. I trusted people who ended up breaking me. 
I don’t know who to trust anymore. I don’t think I can be fixed. I am broken. I want to have a restart on life. I want to be a different person. I want to be someone who doesn’t just spout my problems to others and caused them annoyance for me. I want to go back to the ‘me’ before where I can fake being sociable and friendly. I want to just put up a fake smile and pretend to care when I do not. 
I am tired of feeling emotions. I want my brain to stop. I want it to not function anymore. 
I just want people who won’t give up on me when I’m giving up on myself.",severe

I have been going for therapy on and off since I was 15. But now i have hit a wall. My life seems like a mess, I'm living with my parents and I absolutely hate them. Recently i started remembering I've been sexually abused when I was 6 and i told my parents about it, they had a very weird reaction. My mom literally said that she was too and why is it a big deal. You have to move on and deal with it. My mom has depression, I've seen her diary about suicide and literally dealt with her mood swings and silent crying periods for years. Now i feel i;m headed down the same path. I literally treat my bf like my mom treats my dad. It's all going extremely downhill and I can't seem to even get out of bed. Every day something that helps me think is literally hanging myself and that gives me this weird odd joy. I would never really do it but i can't stop thinking of it. Or jumping down. Other than that I have these small meltdowns where i literally need the smallest trigger - ie news, small disagreements, etc that make me scream into my pillow and hit the wall with it. I feel extremely irritated, angry, and frustrated. End of the day, I can't even go back to therapy soon because of the lockdown and I can't do it at home because I'm scared my parents will overhear. I just want a way out of this house and this horrible situation. i want to be able to feel something other than deep sadness that comes after my meltdowns.",severe

I am a 30 year old guy with a bachelor's degree, previously worked as a community coordinator and have been a successful and popular and positive character, that is, until the past two years.
I'm dealing with:
1. Treated with testosterone injections because of low testosterone, this fact affects my sense of masculinity
2. Unemployment of two years
3. deterioration in vision, PVD, Eye Floaters and other vision problems
4. A diagnosis of depression and social anxiety that I am ashamed of
5. Have a benign brain tumer (which doctors say is too small and harmless and doesn't requir a surgery - but this fact makea me scared).
Because of these problems I became an angry, bitter, jeslous and negative person, every day I just talking about my medical problems and very scared for my health, I'm venting anger at those close to me and I want to stop it (my dad tells me just to man up, he doesn't understand my pain, I'm afraid that there's no bright future of carrier, marrige, kids, succses for me).
I am looking for tips on dealing with and accepting the situation (other than conversations with professionals). looking for people who will give ideas of how to live with it and return to living a positive and successful life. People who succeeded in spite of all things.",severe
